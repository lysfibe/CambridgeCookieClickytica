There are a lot of websites where people can rent out lodging (peer to peer rental): Airbnb, 9flats, roomorama, Wimdu ... Trying to find the best place is difficult because you have to access every website to compare. Somebody told me that there is a search engine (meta-search) where you can find a lot of places at the same time, but I can't remember the name and can't find it.

Is there a such website?

If so, which P2P rental sites are included and which excluded (so to be searched ' by hand')?
I am filling in the UK online visa application on visa4uk.gov.uk. They ask if I am travelling &quot;with&quot; anyone. My plans have been made in conjunction with someone else, we arrive at the same time and leave at the same time and some of our tickets have both our names on them although our movements will differ some of the time, and we are doing separate interviews. I would like to give them every detail possible to as not to be accused of withholding information. 

However there is this question about &quot;does this person have a valid visa for the UK?&quot;. The answer is &quot;not yet&quot;, he will not have a visa until his own application process is complete (just like me). However the options are &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. So the correct answer is (currently) &quot;no&quot;. Will this cause my own application hassles?
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.padmapper.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Padmapper&lt;/a&gt; aggregates AirBnB, Craigslist and more traditional sites for America, Canada and the United Kingdom. In general these sites target different areas which is probably why a global search engine doesn't exist.
The UK Business Visitor Visa is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407476/HC_1025_Immigration_Rules.pdf&quot;&gt;being abolished in 27 (24 April 2015) days&lt;/a&gt; so your question has limited life.  The new rules will be posted at Immigration Rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/412242/Immigration_Rules_-_Part_2.pdf&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; 

On the start date (24 April) of the new rules, your BVV will automatically convert to a Visitor (standard) visa. You don't have to do anything for this to happen.  


  People who hold a valid visit visa that was issued prior to 24 April
  2015 can use this to enter the UK provided they are still a genuine
  visitor. 
  
  They will be able to use this visa to carry out the additional
  permitted activities. For example, a person with a business visit visa
  can use this to enter the UK for a holiday or to receive private
  medical treatment.


Source: email from the Home Office to UK lawyers sent on 3 March 2015

The Visitor (standard) visa allows you enjoy tourism or business or recreational coursework for as much as you want on multiple visits until it expires.

For your other questions, you will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have a landing interview with a British Immigration Officer who will determine if you still qualify.  They will look at the same paperwork you originally used with your application so you should bring it along.  As long as you are still a genuine visitor, you will have no problems.

Adding

As always, during a transitional period when old rules change to new rules, it's advisable to carry a print-out of the relevant rule with you.
In general, they are trying to find out if, for example, a child is travelling with their parent or if a person is travelling with their spouse.   Also they are trying to establish the person's premise for visiting the UK and sometimes if a person is travelling with a group the info can be useful.  Finally, the info is helpful in understanding the applicant's connection to the UK (if there is one) and if their visit is contingent on another person getting a visa.

Based upon what you wrote, you are travelling with a friend/companion.  You would answer the question honestly and check the 'NO' box if the person does not have a valid UK visa.

Optionally, you can then go to Part 9 of the form and enter a brief explanation of how and when your friend/companion will apply for their visa.  In fact you can simply reword your text above (i.e., your question) and copy it to Part 9.  It is OK to be explicit about your relationship with your friend/companion because it helps establish the premise of both your visits.
I am not an EU citizen and I am moving to France.  I received a 90 days visa saying &quot;type C&quot; on it with an attached but unstamped note saying that: 1) this in fact is a &quot;D type&quot; (long stay) visa 2) as soon as I arrive to France I need to apply for a &lt;em&gt;carte de s�jour&lt;/em&gt;, which will then &lt;em&gt;replace&lt;/em&gt; my visa.

&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
Will I be able to travel within the Schengen area using this &lt;em&gt;carte de s�jour&lt;/em&gt;?
Will I be able to travel to Romania using the &lt;em&gt;carte de s�jour&lt;/em&gt; (normally possible with valid Schengen visas)?
&lt;/ol&gt;

My understanding is that the &lt;em&gt;carte de s�jour&lt;/em&gt; doesn't come with an additional visa stamped in the passport.  Thus the only thing I could show to the Romanian border control is the residency card.
This is the scenario:

I have tickets booked for a 13:40 scheduled flight with Emirates. I need to check bags in so plan to be at the airport at the advised 2 hours before flight departure (11:40) but I look ahead and see my plane is delayed and not scheduled for departure until 16:40. 

Can I arrive at the airport at 14:40 to check-in or should I knowingly arrive at the airport a full 5 hours before the revised departure time?

&lt;em&gt;Footnote: The reason of the delay is that the inbound flight which will become be my outbound flight after turnaround is delayed in arriving at my departure airport.&lt;/em&gt;  
&lt;strong&gt;No you can't turn up late to check-in on a delayed flight&lt;/strong&gt;, unless the check-in closing time is delayed along with the departure time. Note that usually this is not the case.

The check-in closing time is set relative to the scheduled departure, and usually remains the same, regardless of whether the flight is delayed or not. Hence if you show up at the airport late for check-in, even though you still have plenty of time before boarding due to the flight being delayed, you will be considered as a no-show. This happened to me a few years back on a snowy day in which all inbound and outbound flights to/from LHR were delayed.

Several websites and forums mention this (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.farecompare.com/news/gate-on-time-flight-delays/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ask.metafilter.com/64691/The-internet-says-my-flight-is-delayed-What-do-I-do&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). However I believe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airberlin.com/en/site/checkin.php&quot;&gt;this webpage from Air Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to be more authoritative:


  We are unable to check in passengers arriving at the check-in desk after the check-in deadline. These passengers lose their entitlement to be carried on the flight and do not have any right of reimbursement, issue of a credit note or free rebooking. &lt;strong&gt;This check-in deadline will remain the same even if the departure of the flight is delayed.&lt;/strong&gt;


(Emphasis mine)

Other airlines, including Emirates and British Airways, carry no mention of whether the check-in deadline can be modified, probably because they assume that when flights are delayed the check-in closing time does not vary. However they do mention that arriving late for check-in will cause you to be denied boarding in their Terms of Carriage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ek.aero/english/images/english%20final10may2012%20%20(3)_tcm233-194795.pdf&quot;&gt;Emirates (in PDF)&lt;/a&gt; says:


  6.3 You must comply with the applicable Check-in Deadline. We have the right to cancel your
  reservation if you do not comply with the Check-in Deadline or, if no Check-in Deadline has been
  indicated, you fail to check-in prior to closing of check-in for your flight. See also Article 5.7.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britishairways.com/en-us/information/legal/british-airways/general-conditions-of-carriage&quot;&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; says:


  &lt;h3&gt;6c) You must check in by the check-in deadline&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  If you do not complete the check-in process by the check-in deadline, we may decide to cancel your reservation and not carry you. By completing the check-in process we mean that you have received your boarding pass for your flight.

Residence permit holders in the Schengen area (certainly in France) typically don't have or need a visa to enter either their country of residence or the Schengen area as a whole. The common format residence permit is enough for that.

You simply present the card (together with your passport) to the border guards or, if needed, to the airline when boarding your flight. In the first few years of this system, some friends did come across airline/ground handling personnel who were unfamiliar with these residence permits but they should at least be able to call a supervisor or to find documentation confirming the rule. I would hope most are familiar with them by now.

A Schengen residence permit can also be used to travel to Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia or Cyprus. You will find documentation to that effect in many places, including for example on the website of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mae.ro/en/node/2040&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt;:


  V. Do I need a visa?
  
  […]
  
  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  NO
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  […]
  
  ​The holders of Schengen visas with two or multiple entries, national visas &lt;strong&gt;or residence permits&lt;/strong&gt; issued by Schengen Member States.


As you can see, the exact same rules apply to residence permits and to valid Schengen visas.

Note there are different types of &lt;em&gt;carte de séjour&lt;/em&gt; but all of them should count as a residence permit under the Schengen regulations (in French “&lt;em&gt;titre de séjour&lt;/em&gt;” and not “&lt;em&gt;carte de résident&lt;/em&gt;”, which is something much more specific). A “&lt;em&gt;récépissé de première demande de carte de séjour&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;autorisation provisoire de séjour&lt;/em&gt;” or “&lt;em&gt;récépissé de demande d'asile&lt;/em&gt;” however does not. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F1765.xhtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vosdroits.service-public.fr&lt;/a&gt;.
If your gf did not report her variance to the Italian consulate, and did not enter Italy first (or spend the majority of her visit in Italy), then her next application is imperilled, but not necessarily a de facto refusal.

For cases like this, they are &lt;em&gt;entitled&lt;/em&gt; to use Refusal Grounds # 8...


  ...the information submitted regarding the justification for the
  purpose of the intended stay was not reliable...


what that basically says is that they do not trust her based upon her performance.  

Of course it's not an automatic refusal and the net has countless anecdotes where people applied successfully.  

So the answers to your questions are...  yes, she should be concerned.  The worst case scenario is a refusal on #8.

And for your last question, how can it be remedied...  the answer is to get more visas from countries that monitor performance like the USA, Canada, the UK, and so on.  They love to see histories like that.
There's a great view trail at the superfund site (Pritchard Park) and Rockaway Beach but really most of the trails do not give a view of Seattle.
My family and I are planning a holiday trip to Italy from India.  

I was reading the list of documents required for our visa application and saw a requirement to document our socio-professional standing.

I can provide school records or income-tax returns for me and my father.

The real problem is my mother doesn't have any of the documents requested in order to show her socio-professional standing. She's a housewife and does not have any educational qualifications, so there are no school records for her.

Are there any other ways to document the socio-professional standing for her?
I have a question about the 90 Day Rule for going to the Schengen Area (I'm an American). Last June around the 20th I entered Germany as a tourist, and around the 30th of June I got an Au Pair visa that allowed me to stay for 6 months. I left Germany around the 10th of December. I am planning to go to Italy in the first week of June this year (just to travel), and am wondering about this whole 90 day within a 180 day period thing. It will not have been 180 days since I left Germany, but if I had a long term visa while I was there, rather than just a tourist visa, will I be allowed to enter and stay for a full 90 days? Does the 180 day period start from when I first entered Germany, thus I really only used 10 &quot;tourist visa days&quot; before leaving?

I realize this is a super specific question, so if anyone can even just point me in the right direction as to where to find more info on this that would be great!
I wouldn't go by bus, at least from Madrid to Sevilla, so boring. Instead i would go by ave (high speed train) that is more expensive but as they said above, if booked in advance the ticket could be cheaper than the bus.
As far as the maximum stay rule is concerned, you should be fine, for two reasons:


The rule is such that you only need 90 days (and not 180 days) between stays. It's a bit counterintuitive but if you left 91 days ago, the first day of your first 90-day stay is now exactly 181 days in the past and does not count anymore. So you have the right to stay for one day. The day after, the second day of your first stay is now out of the sliding window too (but the first day of your second stay counts!), so you still have exactly one day left. And so on until you reach 90 days again. With multiple stays, the whole thing can get confusing but fortunately there are calculators to help, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13183/about-schengen-90-180-rule&quot;&gt;How does the Schengen 90/180 rule work?&lt;/a&gt;
The time spent under a long-stay visa (like your au-pair visa) is indeed excluded from the count. For more on that, see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen/24777#24777&quot;&gt;Does tourist visa (90 days) apply after a long-term visa ends in Schengen countries?&lt;/a&gt; You could even stay for 90 days immediately after the end of your long-stay visa or &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/does-tourist-visa-90-days-apply-after-a-working-holiday-visa-ends-in-schengen/35406#35406&quot;&gt;leave and re-enter the Schengen area during this time&lt;/a&gt;. Do carry any relevant documentation with you (au-pair visa, proof that you left the country, things about your status in the US or what you plan to do in Italy, etc.) in case there are questions but I would not expect any problem (don't volunteer anything, just have it ready if needed).

If your mother does not have something to show for socio-professional, she can still submit documents on the strength of her social standing (i.e., the 'socio' part of socio-professional).  

Examples would include, her marriage certificate, church/religious memberships, other memberships and affiliations that demonstrate an engagement with society.  A reference from the family doctor might be helpful, but shouldn't be seen as &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt;.  

Since she is applying as part of a family group, it is unlikely to make a big difference either way.  They are aware that not every applicant has  formal credentials and as long as the primary is acceptable they will normally grant the dependant relatives a visa also.
Just to confirm that what they say above about high crime rates is not true. I've been living for more than 20 years in several cities of that area and i could say that you could feel safe walking in the streets almost at any time of day and night. Of course that there exist places where is better not to go.
I'm taking my skis with me on a plane for the first time, and so I'm a little unsure of the best practices to make sure everything arrives safely.

&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;: How can I make sure my skis arrive in two pieces and not more? Is there anything possible to protect the ski bindings (they stick out from the skis) or the poles? What about the boots, how banged up will they get? I have a ski and boot bag, but they're not really padded.

&lt;strong&gt;Luggage policies&lt;/strong&gt;: Most airlines seem to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snowpak.com/news/toolkit/skiandsnowboardbagfees.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;allow&lt;/a&gt; an additional boot bag for free, as long as it only contains boots. Can I stuff additional gear in my ski bag, provided it's under the 50 lb limit? Does the weight limit count the combined ski/boot bags, or just the skis?

&lt;strong&gt;Airport&lt;/strong&gt;: Do most airports have a separate check in and pickup counter for oversize equipment like skis?
You say &quot;I always swipe them &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the barriers&quot;. But if you mean placing them on the yellow circle, that's for plastic 'Oyster' passes or contactless debit/credit cards, used on all public transport in and around London. This system does require you to swipe on entry and exit to the system in order to charge you correctly, even if the barriers are open.

But paper tickets/passes like yours, which are used on the whole UK rail system, go in the slot beneath it and are spat out above. If the barriers are locked open, the slot will usually (always?) be locked too and so you can't put them in anyway. So you just walk through and show to the staff if asked.
Skiis are pretty darn durable  afterall they are built to carry 150 kilos of flailing human through meter tall moguls.  And how many times have you stomped them with your ski booted foot to release the bindings.  They will travel just fine.

Poles can get bent, but you can always strap them together for more strength or to your skiis.  Or if you are really paranoid, you could wrap the shafts with some cardboard.

Boots again are built to be abused.  But always good idea to buckle them up, so there are no loose hanging bits to be caught and broken off. Some folks put each boot in a plastic bag to further protect buckles from being caught by ski poles or bindings.

Airports that serve ski areas often have a separate baggage claim for oversized items.  

Check in however is usually at the same counter with every one else.  Some airports will have an oversized baggage drop point where you will take your skiis after check in.  Some will just set your skiis to the side and a baggage handler will come pick them up.
Are there any special documents needed to enter Japan as a single, fully custody, parent of a 16 year old minor?

We will only be in Japan for 7 days on a tourist visa.

I've checked &lt;a href=&quot;http://japan.usembassy.gov/e/acs/tacs-7108b.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and can't seem to find any information on the subject. 
After some quick searching, I wasn't able to turn up anything specific either. However, Japan now does subscribe to the Hague Convention. This assumes that the minor child has a passport and that the other parent is alive. So, to be safe:

&lt;ol&gt;
A notarized statement from the non-custodial parent stating that you have permission to take the child out of the country, dated within 3 months of travel. 
&lt;/ol&gt;

Whether or not that's possible: 

&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
Notarized copy of decree giving you sole/full custody.
A court order allowing you to take the child out of the country.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Separately: 

&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
Child's birth certificate that includes your name as a parent.
&lt;/ol&gt;
You dont need a tour operator if you want to save money. Just use the transport department buses to get to your destinations and do your own thing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiatravelforum.in/threads/itinerary-help-with-5-days-trip-in-jaipur.254/#post-685&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a post that describes how to do it. The only thing you need to change is the mode of transport which in that post is a taxi. Check out a few tour operators and find out what all they cover and make a list. Use public transport to get there and back. Public transport in India is one of the cheapest in the world especially trains which are subsidized by the government to a great extent.

I hope this helps.

Question: 


  Can I travel to the United States on the Visa Waiver Program to find a
  job or attend interviews and then apply for the E-3 visa once I return
  to Australia?


Answer: 


  Yes, you can travel on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) if you meet the
  requirements (please see our page on the Visa Waiver Program). &lt;strong&gt;If you
  do not meet the VWP requirements, you may be eligible to travel on the
  B-1/B-2 Combined Visa for Business or Pleasure.&lt;/strong&gt;
  
  You must leave the United States before applying for your E-3 visa.


Although the question is about VWP, the answer additionally mentioned that a B-1/B-2 visa can also be used for this purpose (to find a job or attend interviews).
In your particular case you might know when the flight leaves because it's unlikely another plane materializes but in general you need to be quite vigilant: it happened to me that the delay was decreased! Say, you show up for a flight to leave at 1pm, the flight now shows at 3pm but then it boards at 2pm and leaves at 2:30pm. You need to be vigilant with these things.

I find myself basing my trips on whenever there's a cheap flight, rather than setting a specific date to have a vacation.

However, it makes it hard for me to do this if I can't search for the cheapest flights regardless of date.

Is there a way to do this?

&lt;hr&gt;

Edit :

I'm from Australia and Australia-specific or international suggestions will both work. However, for the sake of this question as a generic one, I would ask for you to leave any tools you know of regardless of origin, so it might help future viewers.

Adioso lets you search for any time. Additionally Skyscanner lets you search across an entire month. Generally Skyscanner has a better range.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brenontheroad.com/guide-getting-super-cheap-flights/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bren on the road&lt;/a&gt; has a good overview of searching for a trip in this way. 
I couldn't find a cheaper place either. I haven't stayed there, but from what I know in other cities in Vietnam, hostels are not that popular in Vietnam. 

Also, Vietnamese people tend to be not that friendly towards foreigners. This has to do with wars and other factors. So, what you heard that they don't accept foreigners is probably a valid one. 

I could find a few places at around $8 with decent amenities though.

You can try getting a local to introduce you to a place. Get to know a local (some restaurant would be great - talk to someone casually). There is a very good chance they'll know some good cheap place, and if they introduce you, the guest house will happily accommodate you. 

Many small guest houses do not want to pay for the booking engines or they are simply not aware of them. I have seen this a lot in South Asian and South East Asian countries. 
I also had to leave my baggage in the Chennai airport, so I'm contributing this for the others. (Since there were no recent answers about this with confirmed information)

There is a place to leave your luggage in the Airport. 
In Chennai airport, departures and arrivals, both international and domestic terminals are next to each other, with about 500m distance. Outside the arrivals, walk towards the other terminal. In between the terminals, there is a small room (opposite the airport) with a sign board that says &quot;left luggage facility&quot;. 

They charge INR 100 per bag (regardless of its size) per 24 hours. This price is reasonable IMO (In Delhi, the charge was INR 50 for first 4 hours and INR 5 for every hour after). 

It's open 24 hours. You can drop and pick up bags anytime. Maximum time you can leave baggage is 7 days. 
Firstly, the minimum age for children is 8 years so the kids of 10 will be allowed to go on the pathway.

You hold Iranian nationality and will be a temporary resident of Belgium at the time you wish to travel to the U.S. You want to know if you can apply for a visa to visit the U.S. for ten days at a U.S. embassy or consulate in Belgium.

The United States &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/fees/reciprocity-by-country/IR.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;does not restrict&lt;/a&gt; which countries you can apply for a nonimmigrant visa from, as many other countries do. You can apply within any country you've entered legally. You would have to do so anyway, since there is no U.S. consulate in your home country.


  Nonimmigrant visa applicants who are residents of Iran may apply at any U.S. embassy or consulate that provides nonimmigrant visa services, but should be aware that Farsi-speaking officers are only available at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, and the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, and the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai.


One thing to note is that the embassies/consulates in different countries may have different processes for paying for your application and booking your appointment for your interview at the embassy or consulate. You will want to check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usembassy.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;appropriate web page for the country you are in&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. if you are in &lt;a href=&quot;http://belgium.usembassy.gov/visas/visas.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; you need to book your appointment and pay the application fee through &lt;a href=&quot;https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-be/niv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a separate website run by a contractor&lt;/a&gt;).

Note that because of visa reciprocity, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/fees/reciprocity-by-country/IR.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;maximum visa validity an Iranian citizen can obtain&lt;/a&gt; for a B-1/B-2 visitor visa is a single entry visa valid for 90 days. If your documentation demonstrates that you can afford your visit to the U.S. and will depart at the end of your visit (and will not overstay your visa), you should have no trouble obtaining the visa.
I don't know what's your source of information and what kind of shop are you talking about. The fact is that 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31th are normal labour days, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Spain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;not bank holidays&lt;/a&gt;. Only 1st of January is a bank holiday in Spain. 26th is bank holiday only in Catalonia (Barcelona). 

In my experience, you won't have any problem that days.
I'm landing in PTY airport at 17:00 and I want to catch the night bus to Almirante (Bocas del Toro) around 20:00. If there is a delay I know I'll need a taxi, but if not I think I have time to go to Albrook bus station on bus or similar. What's the cheapest way to get there? 
I'll be travelling around in Thailand in July and I actually want to do an elephant trek, but I've read a variety of blogs/articles/etc about the elephants being mistreated. Is this the case at every elephant park or not? 

I'll be visiting Chiang Mai, Bangkok and Ko Samui. Is there any place/organization that you know of which treats the elephants well at one of these places? 

I've also found an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/enp/en/12-elephant-nature-park-single-day-visit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;elephant nature park&lt;/a&gt; online where you can walk beside elephants and feed and bathe them, so they are treated right. Does anyone have experience with this Because it seems like a great alternative. 

Is there a place and where or do you recommend the alternative above all others? 
I'm planning a trip by bus or train, even a shared taxi if necessary (but I prefer train), from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan, but I don't plan to get a Kazakhstan visa, so better not to go through Kazakhstan.
Is it possible?
Where you are from and where you want to go? For flights around Europe you could try &lt;a href=&quot;http://airixo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;airixo.com&lt;/a&gt;. It will show you all the places you can fly to from your location, when and for how much (you can filter the results by maximum number of changes etc.).

Downsides: it's basically just Europe and it seems they search only low-cost carriers.
There are some businesses that routinely close and furlough during the week between Christmas and New Year's, but these are places like child care centres, nurseries, mom and pop small businesses in the suburbs, consultancies, and law offices.  These businesses are not reliant upon the tourist trade and will not affect your access to shops and tourist venues.

Additionally, the week between Christmas and New Year's is often targeted for train maintenance such as track repairs and signal installation.  However, the affected lines are generally infrastructural or used by commuters.  So in this case you would expect a light 'holiday schedule' for public transport running INSIDE Madrid and Barcelona accompanied by significantly reduced service between these cities and their suburbs/dormitory communities.  These maintenance schedules have minimal impact on the tourist trade.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurail.com/trains-europe/trains-country/trains-spain#traintypes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;high-speed train between Madrid and Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; for example will operate on a normal schedule.

Having said all of that, take note that areas in and around Barcelona (such as Sitges and Tarragona) are a beloved holiday zone for Northern Europeans and you may need to make dinner and clubbing reservations well in advance.

Applying for schengen visa requires Health insurance policy with a minimum coverage of €30,000 for emergency hospital and repatriation expenses.

I will be visiting Italy with my mother and father for tourism purposes.

So I want to ask if each one of us is required to have a Health insurance? Is it really necessary or optional?

i'm asking  because €30,000 seems to be a large amount for us.
For your first question, yes, each traveller needs a policy that complies with the regulations...


  ...proof of sufficient medical coverage will be necessary at the time of
  the visa application. Medical insurance requirements for the Schengen
  visa are:
  
  
  Minimum coverage shall be EUR €30 000 (equivalent to $50,000 USD)
  Cover must be valid within the Schengen region and for the full    duration of stay
  Cover any expenses which might arise in connection with repatriation    for medical reasons, urgent medical attention and/or
  emergency    hospital treatment or death
  


You will not be able to successfully apply for a Schengen visa without proof.

For your implicit question about EUR 30,000, this is the &lt;em&gt;policy coverage amount&lt;/em&gt;.  To receive this coverage you would pay the &lt;em&gt;premium amount&lt;/em&gt;.  You didn't include the length of your stay in Italy, but &lt;em&gt;premiums&lt;/em&gt; generally start at EUR 30 - EUR 45 for the minimum coverage and increase according to any additional options you select.  You do not have to put up EUR 30,000.  

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_floor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;price floor&lt;/a&gt; for these policies is set in the competitive market place, but it's reasonable to expect to pay a minimum of around EUR 30, even for a trip of 7 - 10 days.  You need to enter personal details in order to receive a bookable quote, so a precise answer can be given only by a provider.

You acquire a policy (one for each person) using any of the myriads of providers and then print out the policies and enclose them with your Schengen application.  To locate some providers you can search Google with the keywords: '&lt;code&gt;Schengen Health Insurance&lt;/code&gt;' (or a suitable translation of it).

Finally, the controlling reference for your question (i.e., the regulation itself) is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R0810&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Travel Medical Insurance&lt;/a&gt;...
Yes it's possible.  There are three main border crossings between the two:


  
  Dostyk/Dustlyk: main border crossing on the road between Osh and Andijon. Public transport and shared taxis are available on both
  sides. Open from 7am to 7pm.
  Khanabad: border crossing on the road between Jalal-Abad and Andijon. Update: may 2013, jalalabad- khanabat border was closed.
  Uch-Kurgan: border crossing on the road between Karakol and Namangan. It’s definitely open. Guards on both sides are generally
  friendly. It’s a very small crossing, and there is no public transport
  going there. Will take 1-2 hours to pass through.
  


Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://caravanistan.com/border-crossings/uzbekistan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Uzbekistan border crossings on Caravanistan&lt;/a&gt;

As someone who has crossed from Uzbekistan into Tajikstan, it's pretty much impossible to get a shared taxi all the way. You generally have to get one from Tashkent to the border, or to the town at the border and then a small one to the border.

You then walk (which in July/August sucks!) in the heat the long walk between the two posts, and on the other side get surrounded by excitable taxi touts who want to charge you tons.  Pause, take a sip of water, and then start negotiating :)  They'll take you to the next town you want to get too ;)
&lt;h2&gt;Bus Is Cheapest But You Need a METROBUS Card&lt;/h2&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tocumenpanama.aero/index.php?cccpage=transporte_publico&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;English version of the Tocumen Airport webpage on public transport mentions only taxis&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easy to assume that taxis are the only form of public transport connecting the airport to the city. This is not the case however, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tocumenpanama.aero/index.php?cccpage=transporte_publico&amp;amp;set_language=es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Spanish version of the Tocumen Airport webpage on public transport also mentions buses&lt;/a&gt;. It also states that bus rides cost 0.25&lt;code&gt;PAB&lt;/code&gt; at the time of writing, regardless of the journey distance. 

Searching on the Panama public transport website yields the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mibus.com.pa/tocumen-via-espana-albrook/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tocumen - Via Espana - Albrook bus line&lt;/a&gt; which, as the name suggests, should take you yo Albrook. Note however that &lt;strong&gt;you can't board a bus without swiping your METROBUS card first&lt;/strong&gt;. What &lt;a href=&quot;http://marvelustravel.com/transportation-shuttle-bus-taxi-minivans/panama-getting-around-rental-bus-transport-international-routes-shared-vans-collective.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;other websites&lt;/a&gt; suggest is to ask for locals to swipe theirs for you in exchange for a bit more than the nominal bus fee.

&lt;h2&gt;Taxis and Other Shuttle Services&lt;/h2&gt;

You've probably also tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rome2rio.com/s/Panama-City-Airport-PTY-Panama/Albrook&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rome2Rio which also suggest a number of combinations with a taxi/driving segment&lt;/a&gt;. These include taxi-train combinations, which seem to be the cheapest (20-25&lt;code&gt;EUR&lt;/code&gt;), as well as single taxi rides (30-35&lt;code&gt;EUR&lt;/code&gt;). The last entry in Rome2Rio however mentions a shuttle, which seems to cost the same as a taxi ride (30-35&lt;code&gt;EUR&lt;/code&gt;). Checking on &lt;a href=&quot;http://marvelustravel.com/transportation-shuttle-bus-taxi-minivans/panama-getting-around-rental-bus-transport-international-routes-shared-vans-collective.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the shuttle service website&lt;/a&gt; shows that these shuttles are not buses. Rather they are a private minibus/minivan service which might or might not take you to Almirante &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; as this destination isn't shown on the aforementioned webpage.
I'm writing my master thesis on Travel Retail &amp;amp; Duty Free with a specific focus on Heathrow's terminal 3 boutiques. In order to visit this terminal and take pictures for my research paper I already spent some money on a flight to Paris CDG- which unfortunately boards at terminal 4.

&lt;strong&gt;Is there any way I could access the Duty Free zone of Terminal 3 prior to boarding my flight at Terminal 4?&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;strong&gt;If not, how could I access the post-customs Duty Free zone of Terminal 3? Whom should I contact?&lt;/strong&gt; 

NB: it's solely for research purposes, not to go on a shopping spree.
I lived in Chiang Mai for over two years but never got around to visiting one of the few elephant parks in the region. There are a few parks that are known for their fair treatment of elephants, it not being uncommon the elephants at these parks to have been sourced from circuses and whatnot, where they would have been treated, well, not very well.

I don't exactly remember the names of the elephant parks that were considered to take care of the animals properly, but the below might be one of them.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.baanchangelephantpark.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www2.baanchangelephantpark.com&lt;/a&gt; 
Many good answers here already. But I have been to China before, and used GPS with a very good precision, and with Google Maps. Also, dealing with the coordinates and mobile device GPS is part of my profession, so let me pitch in. 

GPS satellites are nothing more than a satellite network that spreads a signal of a timestamp that mobile phones or any GPS chip can catch, and then figure out the longitude, latitude, and the altitude. It works anywhere in the Earth surface unless it's jammed. 
In addition to GPS signals, mobile phones can use the location data provided by the mobile carrier (GSM, 2G, 3G and LTE) to assist in this. 

I do not have any references, but China does not block GPS signals. It does however block Google, which can prevent your phone's Google Maps app from showing your location on a map. Accessing Google services in China is somewhat troublesome. Gmail, Google search, and many other services are blocked. Google Maps, however, worked very well in Beijing. China's firewall is based on IP addresses and host names, so it's possible that I was lucky to access it somehow. 

The reason why you can find your location when you are connected to a WiFi network is because your phone can use triangulation to determine your location. It just uses nearby wifi network names and query Google/Apple services to get the location, which would have been recorded before through other people. You do not need to connect to any network. Your phone can get the signal strength (measured in dB), and figure out the location. 

What you really need is a good offline map, because Google services are inaccessible. I have had a lot of success with Open Street Map (iPhone/Android: &quot;City Maps to Go&quot; app can download them for you, and provide GPS pin pointing feature on the maps). Works very well in China. 

For better GPS connectivity, try to get your phone outdoors and keep a direct line to the sky. There is a lot of fog/smoke condition in China, specially Beijing. It's just factory smoke and nothing with iron particles (which can counter act signals). Keep your Wifi turned on. If you are nearby any public wifi hotspot, there is a very good chance of finding your location quickly. 
Cuba is famous for its 1950's and older American cars in daily use. And it's easy to catch a ride in a 1950's Chevrolet taxi.  But is there anywhere I can &lt;em&gt;drive&lt;/em&gt; one of these old cars for a fee?
If you can check-in and pass security more than 2 hours before the flight is due, you could pass through at terminal 4, and use the inter-terminal buses on airside.
I have not used those buses so I am not really sure that you will not have to show that you need to be at the other terminal. But I do know that the buses do run between the terminals, airside.

Added after further reading:

Looking at one of the other questions on this site I would say my suggestion is not going to work: &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17709/can-we-switch-terminals-at-heathrow-lhr-for-shopping-only&quot;&gt;Can we switch terminals at Heathrow (LHR) for shopping only?&lt;/a&gt; states that you need a boarding pass for a flight leaving from the terminal before you are allowed on the inter-terminal bus.
There are a lot of tour to visit Embera communities from Panama City, but in some blog posts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viajesyfotografia.com/blog/los-indigenas-embera-del-parque-nacional-del-rio-chagres/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;like this in Spanish&lt;/a&gt;) I've read that you can get there on your own using public transport to the jetty and then you can take a 20-minutes boat trip to the nearest town. 

Where is this jetty? I suspect that it's near Gamboa, because the Embera communities where forced to move to the Changres river area.
At this moment there is nothing available that has all the functionality. However check out the following link. My boyfriend found this during his Europe visits.

There are a number of elephant camps in Chiang Mai that treat the elephants well.

There are several tourist camps, Lampang Elephant Conservation Center, Mae Sa Elephant Camp, Chiang Dao Elephant Camp.  These camps have been around for 30+ years, have their own veternarians on staff, provide all the needs of the mahouts and elephants, raise the young in camp in the open, engage in breeding programs to avoid inbreeding, etc.  LECC has its own elphant hospital.

They are tourist venues so the elephants do put on a show and provide short rides through the forest.  But the elephants only work 3 to 4 hours each day.

There are also several rescue centers such as Baan Chang, Elephant Nature Park, Patara.  These places take in abused elephants, purchase street elephants from their handlers or accept retired elephants (often one whose mahout has died and left no one to care for the elephant).  These camps are more along the line of visit and observe, perhaps help feed or bath the elephants, Patara does allow rides.

The only down side to these places is that as non-profits they need to garner donations so tend to over emphasize the abuse issues, championing themselves as the only ethical folks out there.
You have two options: contact World Duty Free, as @JoErNanO indicated in his comment, or contact Heathrow Airport directly.

Heathrow Airport has a section dealing with media and filming: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediacentre.heathrow.com/filming_permits&quot;&gt;http://mediacentre.heathrow.com/filming_permits&lt;/a&gt; - while main focus is on news filming, from that page you can deduce that they entertain non-news filming and photography as well.

I'm leaving Ireland and I'm going to Canada on a 2 year working holiday.

Should I notify any Irish authorities of this?  e.g. Revenue for tax issues?
Usually international credit cards like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aigtravelguard.net/mastercard/Default.aspx?IdLanguage=1&amp;amp;mod=faq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mastercard&lt;/a&gt; provide a Schengen Letter (covering up to 30k euros in medical assistance, if needed) if you buy tour travel tickets with it, or using it's reward points. I know visa credit card also provides such a benefit, but I'm not able to find an english language online reference right now.

If you bought your tickets using a credit card, you're probably covered and it won't cost you anything else.
Starting with a quote from Department of State website:

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Marriages performed overseas are considered valid in the country where they take place if they are entered into in accordance with local law&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

Supposing you do want to get married legally in an Asian country, please do make sure you meet the requirements of marriage laws in that respective country.

Once the civil marriage takes place, and all papers are signed, the next step would be looking into getting it recognized in the United States. &lt;strong&gt;This is a case of a US Lawful Permanent Resident/ GC holder (that would be your SO), whose spouse (that would be you, on an F1 visa) is inside the USA through lawful admission.&lt;/strong&gt; From this point on, my advice is to declare as married when required.
I'm guessing you eventually want to become a GC holder, too, since you mention the intention of staying in the US. We're talking about Adjustment of Status, essentially. USCIS instructions are (quote):

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;File Form I-130. After a visa number becomes available, apply to adjust status to permanent residency using Form I-485.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Make sure to maintain an original or certified copy of your foreign marriage document, along with a notarized translation. This will be required for tax purposes, or a change in your immigration status.

I am taking a business trip to Hong Kong....flying JFK to HKG....and want to go business class. I hope to use miles to pay for my wife's ticket.  I found a good itinerary for her through Delta, JFK to HKG on China Air, and returning HKG to JFK on Korean Air using miles.  Question: how do I book tickets for me (using $$)on China Air outbound and Korean Air return?  Call a travel agent?
Assuming by &quot;China Air&quot; you mean Air China the mainland airline (rather than China Airlines the Taiwan carrier), I had no problem booking it on Orbitz with a few extra clicks. Kind of expensive though ($10K) vs. $5K-ish on China Air return (both for business class). 
Simply ask the Delta agent to book you a paid ticket on the same flights. They can tie the two reservations together, so any airline imposed changes apply to both bookings.
I will readily presume your family is OK with this idea. It is not our place to speculate on that.

Despite what @GayotFow indicates I can't find any gender specific information. The only airline flying London-Islamabad direct, Pakistan Airlines &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.piac.com.pk/PIA_PolicynTerms/COC.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Conditions of Carriage&lt;/a&gt; says:


  7.7.1 You will not be accepted for carriage if you are under 5 years of age on the date the flight
  commences unless you are accompanied by an escort aged 18 years or more. If you are between
  5 and 16 years of age, we can arrange for an escort, provided we receive 7 Days or more notice
  prior to travel and an extra charge is paid. 


Nothing else in the CoC is about this age range, 7.7.2 only applies to 5-12 year olds.

I would strongly recommend to arrange such an escort. If something goes sideways, you don't want a 13 year old to deal with it alone.

Another airline which specifically mentions Pakistan is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetairways.com/EN/CA/ProductAndServices/UnaccompaniedMinors.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Jet Airways&lt;/a&gt; but only in regards of being a short haul flight for them, no gender specific restriction.

In general, without knowing the specific airline, the above is typical: above 12 the UAM service is optional but strongly recommended. 
My girlfriend who lives in the US wants to visit me in the UK for a couple of weeks. I will be funding her while she stays here and I'm a bit worried she'll have a problem when she arrives and goes through immigration as she doesn't have much in the way of an income at the moment and so they might look at that and refuse her entry.

What do I need to do to make sure she doesn't run into difficulties entering the country?

  she doesn't have much in the way of an income at the moment and so they might look at that


And how on earth would they do that? What if she has no job but has millionaire daddy's credit card? Proof of funds comes up when you apply for a visa but not at the border. And in this case, she doesn't need a visa. Apply the two fundamental rules of dealing with immigration officials and everything will be fine:

&lt;ol&gt;
Never lie to immigration
Never offer information unasked
&lt;/ol&gt;
Your girlfriend will not need a visa to arrive in the UK.  Instead she will be interviewed by a British Immigration Officer and if she's successful she will receive 'leave to enter'.  The terms and conditions for that type of visa are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/412242/Immigration_Rules_-_Part_2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Paragraph 42 of the Immigration Rules&lt;/a&gt;, and hence what the IO will focus on in the landing interview.

The UK Government recommends that each passenger have some documents ready to show the IO.  Here's the screen shot for Americans coming for a visit...

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/18And.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Check if you need a UK visa&lt;/a&gt;

The site goes on to list the types of things they may ask for.  For single, young people travelling alone, the most important are...


proof of employment
proof of funds


If she is unemployed or employed part-time, she may not have a letter from her employer and that could tweak the IO's radar and prompt him to ask for bank statements.  If the bank statements are weak or she doesn't have any, it will arouse concern.

In some cases, refusal seem to be influenced by gender and somewhat arbitrary criteria.  Consider this image...

Some other considerations that may be problematic can be found in a report produced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/research&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Home Office Research Group&lt;/a&gt;...


  Where the sponsor is a boyfriend or girlfriend, the IO may be wary
  that the passenger will attempt to settle, or get married without a
  visa. If passengers lie about having a partner or romantic interest in
  the UK, or about the nature of the relationship, this can seriously
  damage their chances of being allowed to enter the country. Sometimes
  when IOs are not happy with some aspect of a story, they may put out a
  call to see if anyone is meeting the passenger in the arrivals hall;
  on occasion this produces a partner or spouse.
  
  IOs claim they take a closer look if they discover that the passenger
  and sponsor hardly know each other, have only just met, or perhaps
  have never met at all. Officers will seek to determine why the
  passenger is making the trip, and why at this particular time. If the
  sponsor and the passenger are in the same line of business, the IO may
  suspect the passenger is here to work.
  
  Officers commented that internet relationships tend to generate a lot
  of cases, and are a particular problem among &lt;strong&gt;American passengers&lt;/strong&gt;.
  If the passenger is young, single and unemployed, there are concerns
  that he or she may be trying to start a new life in the UK.

&lt;hr&gt;

So your girlfriend should be straight up about your relationship and prepared to demonstrate ties to the USA.

You can also mitigate these things somewhat by preparing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://londonelegance.com/transpondia/sample-confirmation-letter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;invitation letter&lt;/a&gt; explaining that you will accommodate and maintain your girlfriend.  To carry any weight, the letter should include bank statements and your employee contract.  If you are NOT in council housing, it would be helpful to include something about that also.

As pointed out in comments, the majority of people sail right through their landing interview and never realize that they have received a visa.  Some are not so lucky, and it pays to be prepared.

For example Brisbane has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/parks-venues/parks/park-facilities/parks-barbecues-brisbane#/?i=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;490 parks&lt;/a&gt; with public BBQ's.
The check-in time has no relation to the flight being delayed. The counter will close on time, even if the flight never departs on time.

This is because there are other things that need to happen for the flight to leave that are dependent on the check-in desk:

&lt;ol&gt;
Passenger manifest.
Seat reservations/upgrades/changes.
Luggage has to be tagged, the tags have to be entered in the system.
Luggage has to be scanned and transported to the loading bay.
Luggage may need to be loaded onto freight containers.
Passengers may have to pass through immigration.
There might be travel time (walking time) to the gate.
&lt;/ol&gt;

All that needs to happen; irrespective of the length of the delay.

There are other considerations too.  At most airports; check-in desks are manned by rotating third-party (ie, non airline employee) staff. So the airline has a limited period in which to check-in passengers, before another set of crew sets up on the same station.

At some locations, the physical counters are restricted as well.

Granted, this isn't a problem if you are departing from Dubai and are on Emirates since they have a dedicated terminal (so all counters are checking in Emirates flights), but the flight itself may not be open (or be closed) for booking (in the reservation systems).

In short, do not gamble with timing.

  If I came to the US as a single student on an F1 visa, then during
  college vacation got married abroad (but did not register it in any
  country) is it okay to declare my marital status as single?


If your marriage was never registered (ie, there is no record of it), then you are legally not married. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/45347/1375&quot;&gt;s.brody's answer&lt;/a&gt; on why this is important).

Secondly, if your union is not recognized - you may have get married again in the US in order if you intend to stay with your spouse beyond the remit of your F1 visa.


  My spouse is a Green Card holder also living in the US. We just want
  to get married in Asia (we are both of Asian origin).


If you want to get married outside of the US, and use that union to enter and stay with your spouse, then the first condition is that your marriage should be registered and these documents (marriage certificate, notarized, etc.) are the first step in getting your permit to enter the US &lt;em&gt;for the reason of staying with your spouse permanently&lt;/em&gt;.

Regarding your concern about re-entry to the US. As long as your F1 is current, and you are admitted for studies - then you can re-enter the US.

Once inside, it will be up to you and your spouse to decide what course of action to take, but keep in mind that you will need some documentation of your change in marital status in order to move things forward.

For more information on the requirements, you can refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-130instr.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;instructions for filing I-130&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), where you will see the following conditions:

&lt;ol&gt;
You and your spouse have to be physically present at the ceremony.
The marriage has to be consummated.
As proof of your relationship, you have to present a marriage certificate.
&lt;/ol&gt;
I do not think you need to do that at least no in China I do not know policies in Ireland. Make sure you check with someone more crediable.
I am pretty sure this is a long discussed topic but anyhow I am a bit confused on how to pack my baggages for a 3 weeks trip into the US from Germany with US Airways.

I want to have the following equipment with me on the trip:


Canon EOS DSLR without replacement battery (just original)
Nikon small digicam 
iPhone + Powerbank for Recharging


I am aware of the situation about batteries, especially Lithium-Ion batteries which are all of those device batteries.

I will carry the iphone and the powerbank (both charged to show they work) in my cabin baggage.
As far as I understood I will need to put the powerbank in my cabin baggage in an antistatic plastic wrap?

But I am not sure If I am allowed to put the Canon DSLR as it is (inserted battery) into my baggage. Same goes for the small nikon digicam.
Or do I have to put the cameras into baggage but take the batteries with me, also separated in antistatic plastic wrap?

Can anybody lighten me up please?
&lt;h2&gt;Cameras when flying.&lt;/h2&gt;

You should always take expensive equipment, like cameras, in your hand luggage. 
If you have only the one battery it should sit in the camera. It is only when you have spare batteries that you might run into problems.
But having traveled with one or even two spare batteries for my Canon super compact camera as well as a spare battery for my phone, I have never had inquiries about them when passing security.

I keep the spare batteries with an official battery cover in a pocket of the camera bag. That is according to the rules as I read the TSA website.
For the phone battery I never had a cover but I have it wrapped in a plastic bag in a fitting box and it sits in my handbag. Maybe not 100% to the rules but clearly out of harms way and as it is just the one small item, the security guards do not seem to worry about it.

Here you find the official TSA rules. German Airports as all EU airports, for your return journey, do keep rules very much alike, if not always completely the same: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/safe-travel-batteries-and-devices&quot;&gt;http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/safe-travel-batteries-and-devices&lt;/a&gt;
I am going to travel to UK, I have a Greek blue paper that is my residence,

The METROBUS Card can only be purchased in the selected Point of Sales and Recharge (POS). Unfortunately, at the time of writing, according to the METROBUS website it would seem that there is no METROBUS POS at Tocumen Airport. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tarjetametrobus.com/index.php/atencion-al-cliente/puntos-de-recarga/pos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here is an up-to-date list of these POS from the METROBUS website.&lt;/a&gt; However &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.prensa.com/impresa/panorama/Viajeros-caminan-metros-autobus_0_3829867034.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this online newspaper article from La Prensa dating 2013&lt;/a&gt; mentions a that the sale of METROBUS cards at the airport is a service which has long been delayed and seems to be available now:


  Al menos ya se cuenta con la venta de tarjetas y centro de recarga dentro de la terminal a�rea, servicio que fue demorado por bastante tiempo.


Personally I wouldn't know which source to believe more seeing as there is a general lack of information available online regarding public transport in Panama.

Note that there are indeed buses from Tocumen to Panama City. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tocumenpanama.aero/index.php?cccpage=transporte_publico&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Spanish version of the Public Transport page on the airport website&lt;/a&gt; for more details. The cost of a full-fare ride into Panama City is of 0.25&lt;code&gt;PAB&lt;/code&gt; for the slow buses (Troncales), which run on toll-free roads and take longer (ca. 2h) to reach Panama City, as opposed to 1.25&lt;code&gt;PAB&lt;/code&gt; for the faster buses (Corredores), which take toll roads and reach Panama City considerably faster. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://tarjetametrobus.com/index.php/tarifas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Tarifas page of the METROBUS website&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

Turns out you can't board a bus without swiping your METROBUS card first. What &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294480-i1194-k8112663-Metro_Bus_Card_in_Tocumen_Airport-Panama_City_Panama_Province.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;other websites&lt;/a&gt; suggest is to ask for locals to swipe theirs for you in exchange for a bit more than the nominal bus fee.
I plan to visit Spain and Portugal very soon, and I have received a single-entry Schengen Visa.

I will travel from Spain to Portugal on TAP airlines, which is a domestic flight between Schengen countries.

My question is, upon departure from Portugal, I will be going to a non-Schengen country (Cairo), but I have a layover in Germany which is a Schengen Country. Will I still be able to enter Germany even if I have departed Portugal to a non-Schengen destination?
I'm looking to go on a cruise leaving from New York but have a concern because if I go I will be traveling with a 4 month old infant.

I'm planning on traveling to Israel at some point or another, and I don't know the emergency services number.

&lt;strong&gt;What is the Israeli equivalent of the American 911, or the British 999?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://anglo-list.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=42&amp;amp;Itemid=107/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This Anglo List webpage on the topic&lt;/a&gt; carries information on various useful contact numbers in Israel, including emergency numbers:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wD5oB.png&quot; alt=&quot;Emergency Services: Police, 100; Ambulance, 101; Fire, 102; Electric Company, 103; Local Municipality, 106; Bezeq - Information, 144. Dialing 112 from a mobile phone will connect you to the emergency services&quot;&gt;

Note &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_%28emergency_telephone_number%29&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;you can also use 112 to contact emergency services&lt;/a&gt; in many countries including Israel, in which it is callable from mobile phones only.
If you travel Portugal - Germany - Egypt, you will stay in the Schengen area till you leave Germany, you will have an internal Schengen area flight and get out of the Schengen area when you leave Germany.

If your layover is long enough you can leave the airport. For most European airports they advise not to leave the airport if your stop is less than 5 hours, but it does differ between the different airports.

On the other hand, if you fly from Portugal to Egypt and then to Germany, you would have left the Schengen area when leaving Portugal and would not be allowed into Germany, as your visit would be a second entry into the Schengen area.
I searched for infant in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carnival.com/core/faq.aspx&quot;&gt;Carnival FAQs&lt;/a&gt; and found the following (in order of relevance to you)


&lt;strong&gt;Minimum age for sailing is 6 months&lt;/strong&gt;, with the exceptions of Transatlantic, Hawaii and South American cruises, which are 12 months. 
Cribs are provided complimentary in staterooms.  
The onboard nonfree childcare will accept (to a limited extent) children under 2 and children in diapers, and will change diapers if you provide them.
no child in a diaper is allowed in a pool, whirlpool, water slide etc
Baby food and formula is not available onboard. 


So it seems your answer on Carnival is NO. They're not equipped and you're not allowed. I didn't search other cruise lines, but since the rationale for not allowing them is worry that such a small baby could get sick very quickly, I suspect you'll find the same elsewhere.

The rules seem to be very simple: &lt;strong&gt;no eating, drinking, smoking or chewing gum in public during Ramadan in Dubai&lt;/strong&gt;. This applies to both tourists and locals. Fines and (possibly) jail time are the common punishment for such offenses. Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dubaifaqs.com/ramadan-in-dubai.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dubai FAQs&lt;/a&gt;:


  &lt;h3&gt;Rules and expectations specific to Dubai and the UAE&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  
  It is illegal to eat, drink or smoke in public during daylight hours (including in your car). Urban legend has it that you end up in jail for the remainder of the month of Ramadan if caught, however it is more likely that you'll get a lecture from the police and possibly a fine. The law says a fine up to 2000 / 2500 dhs or up to 1 or 2 month jail sentence as far as we know.
  


Should you be hungry or thirsty you should be able to find an open supermarket with a food alley for non-muslims hidden in the back.

Moreover, you are expected to &lt;strong&gt;dress more conservatively than usual&lt;/strong&gt; during Ramadan:


  
  It is respectful and polite to dress more conservatively during Ramadan - shoulders and legs should be covered, although it is apparent when walking around some of the shopping malls in Dubai that many people either don't know or don't bother.

I want to rent a car for 2 days in Paris but I only hold a debit card (VISA).
Is it possible to rent it without a credit card?

If so, can anybody tell me what car rental company accepts debit card at pickup time?
I heard there are some smaller companies that do that, but I can't seem to find one of it.
I don't like very touristic places, and I don't care about the international renown of a restaurant. I do care about their local renown, since I enjoy to be among the locals. (For instance, I like becoming my menu in without translation, sign that tourists don't discover that place so easily; but that's dispensable). 

Accordingly, I'd like somebody to recommend me a place to eat in Venice and Verona, local traditional dishes (preferentially affordable, but if it's quite good food, it doesn't matter). I'll be there in May (in case it's relevant).
&lt;strong&gt;Kosovo:&lt;/strong&gt;

Based on the list &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,87&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Who doesn't need a visa&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from the Kosovo Ministry of Foreign Affairs, you do indeed need a visa as an Indian citizen.

Based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kosovo.travel/en-us/?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this QA website linked to by the Kosovo MOFA&lt;/a&gt;, it seems you can arrange to mail your passport to one of the visa issuing locations. Based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,159&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Visa application procedure&quot;&lt;/a&gt; page, there is no requirement to show up in person to submit the visa request. Further, one of those locations is in Istanbul. 

Additionally, based on the QA website linked, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,158&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Special Categories&quot;&lt;/a&gt; section of the Kosovo MOFA, it seems holders of multi-entry Schengen visas do not need a special visa to enter Kosovo. However, it is unclear from the documentation if that visa is valid for the full 90 days, or for only 15 days (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldtravelguide.net/kosovo/passport-visa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;World Travel Guide says 15 days&lt;/a&gt;) .

If you take a look at a map of Kosovo, you will see that it only borders Serbia to the North. While not recognized by Serbia, Kosovo is recognized by over 100 nations and has permanent membership in several major global institutions. I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1628/are-there-any-problems-crossing-kosovos-international-borders-or-having-their-s&quot;&gt;referring to this Travel.SE post about traveling between Serbia and Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;. However, if you plan to stay away from the northern part of Kosovo, there seems to be no reason why you would need a Serbian visa. The information in that post is echoed/backed-up by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diplomatie.be/pristina/default.asp?id=30&amp;amp;mnu=30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a blog post by the Belgian Liaison office in Pristina&lt;/a&gt;. Further, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/kosovo/entry-requirements&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the UK government suggests&lt;/a&gt; that Serbian border guards might deny entry into Serbia if they see a stamp from Kosovo.

&lt;strong&gt;Turkey:&lt;/strong&gt;

For transiting, as long as you do not leave the airport terminal, you should not have any need for a Turkish visa. This is common practice is most countries. Also, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/14054/do-i-need-a-turkey-transit-visa-for-a-layover?rq=1&quot;&gt;this Travel.SE post regarding Indians needing transit visas through Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.

Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.konsolosluk.gov.tr/eKonsolosluk/Sayfalar/Visa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the Turkish consulate government website&lt;/a&gt;, if you wish to visit Turkey as an Indian citizen you do indeed need a visa. Much like Kosovo, there is a special provision that will fast-track you for an e-Visa if you already have a Schengen visa.

If both your flights are on Malaysia Airlines, &lt;strong&gt;you do not need to pass through Immigration&lt;/strong&gt;, just board your next flight.
Update: 


In Dubai Mall, during Ramadan (daytime) eating is allowed but not in any restaurant. There is a designated cordoned off area where you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; take your food and are only allowed to eat there. Restaurants that are open will only offer take away service.


&lt;hr&gt;

During Ramadan, the shopping malls will be open (you can get some respite from the heat there), however:

&lt;ol&gt;
No food establishments are open until after sunset; this includes hotel bars, restaurants, etc.
You are not allowed to eat, drink or smoke in public (this applies to everyone, with the exception of children).
There are extended prayers during the evening.
&lt;/ol&gt;

You may be able to order room service if you are staying at a hotel, but keep in mind that in the UAE - it is illegal for non-married couples to cohabitate (this is not something specific to Ramadan, but in general).

Here is a sign from a hotel during Ramadan:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6YL09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

If you are staying in a hotel, you might want to check their policies on room service during Ramadan.

As far as dressing is concerned, I would say use your common sense. In all malls there is a sign describing the rules and guidelines (such as no pets, no skating, no smoking and the dress code).

In general (this applies all the time, not just during Ramadan):

&lt;ol&gt;
No bare shoulders (for both men and women).
No plunging necklines.
No short-shorts or mini skirts (these are only appropriate in clubs, not in malls or when in public).
No offensive clothing (such as shirts with offensive words/phrases).
Shoes are required at all times.
No transparent tops or see through dresses.
No PDA (public displays of affection)
&lt;/ol&gt;

The more you are respectful to the culture, the better treatment you will get. If your clothing is breaking the rules in the extreme, you may be pulled aside by mall security and asked to leave (this has happened in front of me once, to a lady who thought it was okay to wear a see through tank top and her bathing suit at Dubai Mall).
If it's a VISA debit cart, then it can be used as a credit card anywhere VISA is accepted, so you shouldn't have to worry about it.

Note that many rental companies will want to charge the deposit to the card - most likely in the area of €200-300.  This money will be unavailable to you if the charge is on the debit card.

While it's easy to determine whether the card is a debit or credit card (often, but not always) by the card number alone, the rental company won't care.  All they need is to be able to charge the amount owed to them.

On a separate note, I strongly advise that you think carefully whether you really need a car in Paris.  Paris is one of the worst cities in Europe to drive in.

&lt;strong&gt;Updated based on the comment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you want to rent the car to go to Belgium, you may need to inform the rental company that you will be taking the car out of the country - which in turn may make the cost of rental more expensive.  You will likely be breaking the terms of your rental contract if you take the car across the country border without notifying the rental company.
I have a Philippine passport and a Schengen visa. My flight from Barcelona to Stuttgart will make a 10hr stopover at Heathrow. Do I have to apply for any kind of visa with UK?
I am an Australian interested in travelling to Europe for over 6 months.

I am eligible to get a working holiday visa for France, which will allow me to stay and work in France for up to a year. However, in this time I would like to travel the rest of Europe too. As an Australian I can spend 90 days in every 180 days without a visa in the Schengen countries.

Will being in France with the visa count towards the 90 days?

Assuming it doesn't, how will the authorities know how long I've been in the Schengen countries apart from France? I'll be flying to and from France.
I have been through this same situation, except that I was on H1 visa. My spouse was a GC holder and we got married in India. All I had was a certificate issued by the religious institution where our marriage ceremony was held. To register and get the Marriage Certificate from State, we had to wait there for 90 days and physically present to receive the certificate, which was not possible for us as I only had three weeks of leave.

I re-entered US in the same H1-B visa and had no issues. I waited till my spouse became a US citizen and the applied for my GC, which got approved in 4 months.

I had the certificate i got from the religious institution notarized by a notary in India and following are the things I used to prove that we are married while applying for my GC


Latest tax filing report - filed as &quot;Married Filing Jointly&quot;
Kid's Birth Certificate with both our names
Mortgage on both our names
Finally, the notarized marriage certificate


You will be re-entering the US in your existing F1 visa and if you are talking about declaring your status during the tax filing process, or the W2 you are referring to - declaring yourself as &quot;Single&quot;, will not be an issue - but prefer declaring yourself as &quot;Married Filing Jointly&quot; or &quot;Married Filing Separately&quot; - as it might help you when you apply for the GC.

That being said - was entirely my story - please be advised at the same time that


  Marriages must be registered under the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 if
  the persons concerned were married under Hindu, Buddhist, Jains or
  Sikh rites. The Registrar of  Marriages will issue a certificate which
  the consulate will accept as primary evidence of marriage.


As per &lt;a href=&quot;http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/service/other-citizen-services/marriage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;USEmbassy.gov&lt;/a&gt;


  &lt;strong&gt;Religious Ceremonies&lt;/strong&gt;
  
  In India, a religious marriage ceremony is generally considered a
  legal marriage. However, for marriages registered under the Hindu
  Marriage Act (affecting Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists), the
  certificate issued by the temple or gurudwara may not be legally
  sufficient for all purposes. Individuals married under the Hindu
  Marriage Act may seek a formal marriage certificate from the Registrar
  of Marriages. If one of the parties is not Indian, the registrar may
  request a “no objection letter” (see above) and proof of termination
  of any prior marriages.  
  
  If the parties are married in a Christian, Muslim, Parsi, Jewish,
  Baha’i or other religious ceremony, the certificate issued by the
  religious authority (e.g., the church’s marriage certificate, the
  mosque’s nikah nama, etc.) generally is sufficient proof of marriage,
  and no certificate from the marriage registrar is necessary.
  
  &lt;strong&gt;Civil Ceremonies&lt;/strong&gt;
  
  Parties who do not wish to marry in a religious ceremony can instead
  opt for a civil ceremony pursuant to the Special Marriage Act.  Also,
  individuals of different religions should register the marriage under
  the Special Marriage Act, even if a religious ceremony has also been
  performed. This may also require a “no objection letter” (see above),
  as well as proof of termination of any previous marriages. You can
  download a blank “No Objection” letter here (PDF).
  
  The parties generally are required to wait at least 30 days from the
  date of the initial application to formalize the marriage so that the
  marriage officer can publish a newspaper ad allowing for the
  opportunity for any objections to the marriage to be voiced.
  
  The marriage registrar’s office generally is located in a local
  community’s court complex or municipal building.


So, if your marriage was held in a temple, according to Hindu marriage Act of 1955, it might not be valid in US and you will need a Marriage Certificate from the Registrar of Marriage.

But, no one is going to deport you from the US, just because you got married in another country.

If your business visa was obtained while working for a UK company, or if you worked at a UK company after 2005, then the Human Resources department of that company would have taken a photocopy of the portrait page.  You can contact the HR department and ask them to give you a copy of their copy, or simply to tell you the passport number.  They are only obliged to keep records for 6 years (or 14 in some cases) so your luck may hold, or it may not.

Next. If you had pages of your passport certified by a solicitor or notary, they would also have taken a photocopy of the portrait page.  Law firms have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/support-services/help-for-solicitors/practice-advice-service/q-and-as/how-long-should-i-retain-my-closed-files-in-storage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;varying retention framework&lt;/a&gt; unlike companies, and many like to preserve their archives for a long time.

If these fail, and as a last resort, you can file a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-6-rights/subject-access-request/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Subject Access Request&lt;/a&gt; with the Home Office.  There is a fee for this and you must clear hurdles imposed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Data Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;.  A Subject Access Request obliges the Home Office to give you their records about you along with what they know about you...  &lt;em&gt;if they want to&lt;/em&gt;.  The SAR must be in writing, and as you have already observed, calling them is a waste of time.

If all of these do not bear fruit, then it would be reasonable to enter all '9's in the passport field and include an explanation.
I live in Denmark and have Danish citizenship. That means I am not allowed to obtain another citizenship otherwise I will lose the danish one. My question is then: Can I get the kosovo ID card, without losing the danish citizenship, does the ID-card mean citizenship? 
While packing, I noticed a small tear (around 5&lt;code&gt;cm&lt;/code&gt;) on the side of my suitcase. It's only in the outer lining, but I'm worried it could grow during (mis)handling. Getting a new one at this point would be an inconvenience. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pYDrZj5wL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;iron-on clothes patch&lt;/a&gt; that's the correct size. Is it safe to apply it to the suitcase, or would the process cause more harm than good to the material? Any other ideas on how to repair it, or increase its chances of enduring one more trip?

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001DJL1JG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here is a picture of the suitcase on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;
If I understand the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.assembly-kosova.org/common/docs/ligjet/2008_3-L099_al.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; correctly, Kosovan identity cards are only issued to the citizens of the Republic of Kosovo:


  ... p�r shtetasit e Republik�s s� Kosov�s.


This means that you will need Kosovan citizenship (and hence lose your Danish citizenship) to apply for a Kosovan identity card.

Be aware though, that Denmark has already enacted modifications to its nationality law, which will take effect on September 1st 2015, after which you can keep your Danish citizenship even if you are granted another citizenship.
Usually it works the other way around: You need to be a citizen to get an ID-card or passport (some countries do issue ID documents or passport-like travel documents to non-nationals in various cases but those typically have another name). The card is just a convenient way to prove it but citizenship is legally defined based on the circumstances of your birth and other factors and does not depend on actually holding a specific document.

Consequently, if you are eligible for an ID card in Kosovo it would seem to imply that you already are a Kosovo citizen and could therefore already have lost (or be at risk of losing, e.g. by court order) your Danish citizenship, whether you do get a card or not. Of course, if that's the case, actually getting the card increases the likelihood of being found out by the Danish authorities in one way or another. But it would not change your legal status.

Also, I don't know Danish nationality law but whether you were born in Denmark, whether you acquired the Kosovo nationality after becoming Danish, failed to renounce it upon naturalization or whether it is possible to renounce it at all could all make a difference. You need to consider all this to precisely assess your situation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_nationality_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; also suggests Danish nationality law has just become a lot more accommodating with dual citizenship so being considered a citizen in Kosovo might not be as much of a problem as you think.

One further complication in this case is that Kosovo isn't a fully recognized state internationally but I don't know whether this would make a difference, especially considering the fact that it has been recognized by Denmark.
I would not trust the patch alone.  The frame of the suitcase does not provide a place where you can press the iron firmly down.

To make it endure another trip, you can take two towels and lay them flat inside the &lt;em&gt;empty&lt;/em&gt; suitcase so that they overlap the outsides.  Then repack all your stuff.  Valuables go into a shopping bag in the centre.

Then to close the suitcase, fold the ends of the towels over your stuff so that they 'surround' the contents.

This will distribute the stress against the tear more evenly over a wider area.  Once shut, you can use a strip of duct tape or bungee cords (or whatever's handy) to wrap around the outside of the suitcase.  This will prevent the tear from snagging on something and becoming larger.
I would prefer repair tape (easily available on Amazon or from camping supply stores) to an iron on patch. Plastic on the suitcase might melt when you use the iron. Here are some tape images:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mwRCR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;repair tape 1&quot;&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/u4Vja.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;repair tape 2&quot;&gt;

I own some of the Tenacious tape myself but have yet to use it on a suitcase. I take it on long trips and all camping trips. Reviews suggest people repair tents, coats, and sleeping bags with great success and it would seem appropriate for a suitcase also.
There is a company that specializes in tours and/or rentals of nostalgic cars. They can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nostalgicarcuba.com/en&quot;&gt;NostalgiCar&lt;/a&gt;. They provide various tours, as well as airport transfers, but also provide the ability to rent the cars full time. 
As of the weekend of March 28, 2015, miles from US Airways have been merged into the American AAdvantage program (which is the program which will continue on). If you had accounts on both airlines, you were given a chance to link your accounts beforehand; if you only had a US Airways Dividend Miles account, then you were assigned an AAdvantage number.

If you have enough activity on the combined airlines for elite status, then you should have been awarded the appropriate level of status after March 28.

If you find any problems with the account merge, you should reach out to AAdvantage customer service for assistance.
I'm considering a vacation to Panama in the somewhat-near future. (Partly because this would force me to finally learn Spanish, which has been on my to-do list for years ;)&lt;br&gt;
Things would probably be a lot easier if I could rent a car.

What do I need in order to do that? Is there minimum age to rent a car, as there is in the US?

I am an American citizen, and have a current American driver license.
I'm looking to travel into the states for the weekend (I live in Canada). My passport has expired but I have nexus. Can I still use nexus even if my passport has expired?

I have a valid ESTA. When I enter US I will show my return flight booking to leave US. Should I decide to stay longer while I am there, but still within 90 day period, will my rebooked flight date be acceptable?
I am a South African currently in the UK (Wales) on a visiting visa. I work on a cruise line that has there embarkation in Monte Carlo (France). My company is stating a Schengen visa to basically get into France to join the ship not even 24hours later. Is it possible that I could apply for this visa in Cardiff at the French embassy (there is one), and what are the chances of it going thru/being successful. I have valid visas for the USA UK with a few outdated pass thru visas such as/for Italy (Schengen), Croatia, Greece. Would any or all of this help my case in getting a short stay visa for Monte Carlo.
Transport for London are trying to close all Tube ticket offices and move staff into ticket halls—whether or not that is a good idea is another question. Ticket offices, however, are obviously staffed—and thus a tourist with only a non-chipped credit card can still buy a ticket, as a receipt for signature can be printed and signature verified.

But what this does mean is that it seems then that if you're at a station, you'll only be able to buy tickets at a ticket machine—which accept coins, cash, and chip-and-pin cards. Notably, however, the US doesn't issue chip-and-pin cards; at best, they tend to be chip-and-signature. 

Thus, if a tourist from the US (or another country that doesn't issue chip-and-pin) arrives without any pounds, does this mean they won't be able to buy a Tube ticket? Or will staff be able to help in some way? Or has TfL not announced their solution (if any)?
I have a C-business-visitor visa to the UK (multiple entry visa), that I used to represent my NGO in a conference on November. My visa is still valid. Can I use it again to enter to the UK 
to present again my NGO and plan for a training in citizen journalism for young girls in London?

I have a stamp on my visa of the date I entered the UK in.

If yes, what do I have to provide at the airport?
Fortunately ParisInfo has a great few pieces on this:

And finally their piece on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.parisinfo.com/discovering-paris/themed-guides/paris-by-night/practical-guide/night-transport-in-paris&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;night transportation in Paris&lt;/a&gt; - covering the Noctillen buses, Metro, RER, taxis and more.

Somebody told me that on Indian Railways, 60% of seats are reserved for counter bookings and 40% for online bookings.  Is this correct or not?  Because while I am checking seat availabilty on the Internet, no seats are available, but when I went to ask at a ticket counter, berths are available.
Tourists planning to visit the UK can actually buy a Visitor Oyster card in their home countries, if they live in one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/where-to-top-up-and-buy-tickets/overseas-travel-agents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;24 countries where local travel agents sell the cards&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, people in the US can visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raileurope.com/activities/visitor-oyster-card/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rail Europe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visitbritainshop.com/usa/travel-transport/london-transport/product/london-visitor-oyster-card.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;VisitBritain Shop&lt;/a&gt; to purchase a Visitor Oyster card before leaving. If you aren't in one of those countries, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TfL Visitor Shop&lt;/a&gt; will sell you one and post it to you, but it may take several weeks to arrive.

The down side to Visitor Oyster cards is that, unlike regular Oyster cards purchased in the UK, they cannot be &lt;a href=&quot;https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/link/sso/0001.do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;topped up online&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, the Visitor Oyster card offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/experience-london/special-offers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;various discounts&lt;/a&gt; at restaurants, shops and entertainment which are not on offer to regular Oyster card holders.

Once in Great Britain, you may need to top up the Oyster card. If you're an American this is where things get tricky. Most credit/debit cards in the US don't currently support either Chip and PIN or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless/what-are-contactless-payment-cards&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;contactless payments&lt;/a&gt;. The ones you'll receive to replace the ones you're currently holding will have a chip, though most banks seem to be issuing Chip and Signature cards, which are expected to have the same sorts of problems with ticket machines as magnetic stripe only cards do now.

So, your options for using a ticket machine are:


&lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless/what-are-contactless-payment-cards&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Contactless payments&lt;/a&gt; with your American Express card. These are available to US cardholders; check your card for the contactless payments symbol. If your card doesn't have it, American Express will happily send you a replacement card. They also offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/chip/signature.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Chip and Signature cards&lt;/a&gt;, but not Chip and PIN, to US cardholders.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLIqn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Contactless payment symbol on the back of an American Express card&quot;&gt;

A few Visa and MasterCard cards in the US also support contactless payments, as well. But TfL note that some MasterCard contactless payment cards from the US don't yet work in the UK, and older Visa contactless cards may not work either.

Most contactless cards issued outside the UK can now be used directly in lieu of an Oyster card to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless/how-to-use-it&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;touch in and out&lt;/a&gt;, but even if yours does not work, it can still be used to top up your Oyster card. If you have contactless cards, beware of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/using-oyster/card-clash&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;card clash&lt;/a&gt; and make sure to remove the card you wish to use to touch in and out from your purse or wallet.
Chip and PIN cards. Ask your bank or credit card issuer whether they will be replacing your card with a Chip and PIN card or a Chip and Signature card, as all US cards will get chips starting in 2015, (when your existing card expires it will be replaced by one with a chip) but only a few will be actual Chip and PIN. If your bank gives you an option, get a Chip and PIN card.
Cash. Even if you can't get your credit card to work at the ticket machine, it will work at ATMs even if it only has a magnetic stripe. Withdraw some cash and then go top up your Oyster card.


But ticket machines aren't the only place you can top up. You can also visit:


One of many newsagents and retailers around London participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/where-to-top-up-and-buy-tickets/oyster-ticket-stops&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Oyster Ticket Stops&lt;/a&gt; scheme. One of these is likely to be able to accept your magnetic stripe card. Look for an Oyster Ticket Stop sign in the shop window.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/w5ZUo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Oyster Ticket Stop&quot;&gt;
A &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/where-to-top-up-and-buy-tickets/visitor-centres&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;London Visitor Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Located at key points around London frequented by tourists, these staffed centres can top up your Oyster card. You can also buy an Oyster card here, if you forgot to purchase a Visitor Oyster card at home, or decided not to do so. Be specific as to whether you want a regular Oyster card or the Visitor Oyster card, as these locations sell both. One of these is landside at the Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 Underground station, so you need not worry about how you'll leave the airport. Another is in Gatwick Airport in the south terminal arrivals area.


&lt;hr&gt;

A couple of more hints for tourists using Oyster cards in London:


Children under 11 travel free when accompanied by an adult and do not need a separate Oyster card unless they need to travel alone (though I doubt you will want to let your smaller children roam around a foreign country alone!). If your child is over 11 and under 16, bring your child and his or her Oyster card to a central London ticket office or the Visitor Centre at Heathrow to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/travel-for-under-18s/travelling-with-children&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Young Visitor discount&lt;/a&gt; added to it.
If you see a pink card reader when changing trains, touch your Oyster card to it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/using-oyster/pink-card-readers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;qualify for a cheaper fare&lt;/a&gt;. Touching the card reader indicates that your trip avoided more costly routes such as travel in Zone 1.

According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Iran&quot;&gt;Wikitravel&lt;/a&gt;, the thumbs up gesture is extremely offensive in Iran.  However, it's generally what you use when indicating you wish to hitch a ride in many other countries.


  The thumbs up gesture is extremely rude in Iran, roughly equivalent to
  raising the middle finger in Western countries. Hitchhiking is rare in
  Iran, and the country has a good public transportation system. If you
  do hitchhike, do not use a thumbs up signal.


So if you can't use that, what is generally used instead, in Iran?
When you arrive at a port of entry in the U.S., the Customs and Border Protection officer decides how long your visit is allowed to be, and this information will be stamped into your passport as part of your entry stamp.

Most of the time, this is 90 days, but it is possible that, depending on your individual circumstances, you will be allowed less than 90 days on a visit. Regardless, you must leave the US on or before the date stamped in your passport.

I would recommend that when you arrive you declare the maximum amount of time you might want to spend in the US. There's no penalty for leaving early, but the penalties for leaving late can be severe.
This doesn't exist. Per &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Havana&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikivoyage&lt;/a&gt;


  Internet cafes can be found at ETESCA (the state telephone company) offices, in Hotel Habana Libre, Hotel Inglatera (cheapest but slowest), Hotel Nacional and at the Capitolio.


The Wikipedia article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETECSA&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ETECSA&lt;/a&gt;:


  The cost of Internet access is CUC$4.50 per hour (or CUC$0.60 for domestic intranet access and CUC$1.50 for email),


Still Wikipedia on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Cuba&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Internet in Cuba&lt;/a&gt;


  The average cost of a one-hour cybercaf� connection is about $1.50 U.S. dollars for the national network and $5 to $7 U.S. dollars for the international network,


To be fair, the same article mentions a black market where


  the black market consists of professional or former government officials who have been cleared to have Internet access. These individuals sell or rent their usernames and passwords to citizens who want to have access


Obviously, there's no price and in a country like Cuba you quite probably don't want to deal with a black market.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://hitchwiki.org/en/Iran&quot;&gt;Hitchwiki&lt;/a&gt; has:  


  Hitchhiking is done in Iran by waving one's arm at an oncoming car, or by dribbling one of your hands.


I have not seen this myself (experience only of Tehran) because taxis seemed virtually free there anyway but I think I recognise the &quot;dribbling hand&quot; gesture as something that looks to me like an accelerated version of a 'slow down' gesture.
I do this also with USD when I travel.

When you get to Europe don't convert the money immediately. Keep it in your bag/hotel safe unless you need it. Chances are you won't need it, so by not converting it immediately you save yourself possibly considerable cost converting to Euros and then converting the leftover back to AUD.

If you do find yourself needing to change the money, a major bank is your best bet. They often have an exchange rate with a small fee built-in, though it is considerably smaller than the airport kiosks and such that you mention. 

Some vendors at major airports also accept major forms of currency. From my experience, many of these will allow you to pay for an item in your currency, and then give you change in the local currency. This can often we used as an effective way to exchange some money, though my guess is you wouldn't want to use it for large amounts since you would need to purchase something expensive.

It is also important when traveling to look at local laws governing exchange rates. For example, in Russia the exchange rate is almost perfect (you loose maybe $0.05/$1) because agencies are not allowed to charge fees.
Indian Railways has approximately 1 bazillion different quotas (Tatkal, Foreign Tourist, Handicapped, Ladies, ...), but as far as I'm aware, &lt;strong&gt;online bookings are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; one of them&lt;/strong&gt;: both ticket counter and online bookings use the same quotas.  If you're getting different answers online and in person, you're presumably looking at different quotas/tickets/trains/classes?

I'm a New Zealander and I was wondering if I needed an onward or return ticket to go to Canada? 

I have purchased a one-way ticket to Vancouver, but I just wanted to make sure I don't need a ticket out of Canada for immigration.
NZer here who has been to Canada several times (and lived in Vancouver).

You need evidence that you're going to leave the country (I've been asked for it every time, except when I had a residence visa).

This can be in the form of a plane ticket, but that's not always convenient.  Like you, I've been there sometimes with a one-way ticket as I hadn't worked out what I was doing next.

The simplest solution generally is to buy a bus ticket (or refundable plane ticket) to the US.  I use Greyhound for this.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/5828/101&quot;&gt;I actually asked for the cheapest option back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and there are optimal ways, but I found it just sounded more realistic to get one from Vancouver to Seattle, for example.  They're often only like $10-25 with Greyound or Megabus or Boltbus.

Of course, your story needs to be at least possibly accurate, if you're just spending time in BC, having a ticket out of Halifax is going to be odd, so treat it as if that IS actually your plan, and you can change your plan once you're in the country, IF need be.
I’d suggest taking a look at the website of the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau, which has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.parisinfo.com/discovering-paris/themed-guides/paris-by-night/practical-guide/places-to-visit-at-night-in-paris&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;page titled “Places to visit at night in Paris”&lt;/a&gt;. It lists a number of places (mostly museums, some galleries) that have late openings. The page is unfortunately organized by place rather than by what your options are on a particular day of the week, but the “fact sheet” for every place does clearly list “late opening” on the “prices and times” section.

Here are a few suggestions taken from that page, but organized by day of the week (non-exhaustive list):

&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: Musée Jacquemart-André (until 9pm, only during temporary exhibitions).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Jeu de Paume Paris (until 9pm).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Musée du Louvre (until 9.45pm).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;: Musée des Arts et Métiers (until 9.30pm), Musée d'Orsay (until 9.45pm), Musée du Quai Branly (until 9pm).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;: Musée du Louvre (until 9.45pm), Musée du Quai Branly (until 9pm).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;: Musée du Quai Branly (until 9pm), Musée Jacquemart-André (9pm, only during temporary exhibitions).  

There’s also the Palais de Tokyo which is open every day, except Tuesday, until midnight; and the Musée de l'Érotisme is open every day until 2am.

Obviously these times can change, so do check the original “fact sheet”. For most places it also lists until what time before closing time the ticket offices stay open, which would be useful to know.

(Thanks for reopening this question; the above is a slightly extended version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3122/can-the-question-on-which-sights-are-open-late-in-paris-be-reopened&quot;&gt;answer I proposed on the meta SE&lt;/a&gt;).
What should the proof of accommodation be while applying for visa in Europe (Schengen visa) as I will be attending summer festivals (camp facility)?
A ticket for the festival and a note stating that you intend to camp or maybe a printout of the festival website indicating that camping is available should be perfectly fine. Basically everything that shows you have a reasonable and plausible plan can count as supporting documentation. Your application would be much weaker without festival tickets obviously.
In this summer my girlfriend and me will be on vacation for three weeks in the USA / California. We want to make a round trip and already booked a flight to SanFrancisco. From there we plan to rent a car and make a Trip from SanFran to LA (via Highway 1) to SanDiego to Grand Canyon and finally to Las Vegas.

I think we know about all the &quot;common&quot; sights - which also can be found on tripadvisor and other sites on the internet. But for us its maybe the only visit in California (and Nevada -&gt; Las Vegas and a bit of Arizona -&gt; Grand Canyon) in our life, because we're from Germany and the trip will not be very cheap. So my Question is if you have any tips for us of things we should do or places we should visit and are not well known. The tips should  roughly fit for our tour route. So we are not looking for tips like 'drive over the golden gate bridge' or 'go to alcatraz'. ;-)

I know my question is a bit broad. I hope it is not too broad, so that the question has to be closed. I would be thankful for every tip!

kind regards!
I've been travelling a lot and I find it slightly irritating that my VISA provider doesn't provide info for my activity for the last ~2 days. I guess the reasoning is they are waiting for it to &quot;post&quot; because it may just be a verification not a charge, but still it changes my balance immediately and it can be confusing what is doing that so I know when to expect the funds to be released back into my account.
Based upon what's written, you will &lt;em&gt;not be successful&lt;/em&gt; in applying for a &lt;em&gt;Schengen visa&lt;/em&gt;.  This is because your status in the UK is visitor.  Even though your visa has a two year duration, the limit of 6 months does not qualify as a South African who is resident in the UK, and hence the French will refuse your application.

You may be able to qualify for a short-term Seaman's visa...


  Applicants for a seaman’s visa must be employed &lt;strong&gt;in any capacity&lt;/strong&gt; on
  board a vessel, and seeking to enter France solely in pursuit of
  his/her calling as a seaman, with the intention of departing with the
  vessel or reshipping on other vessel that is bound for a foreign port
  or place or one coming to the France to join a vessel in this country.

These visas are not part of the Schengen treaty and are very limited in terms of duration and mobility.
I am not a credit card expert but it happened to me when using both debit and credit cards abroad. Verifications that would not change my balance at home (or perhaps be cancelled after a few minutes…) looked like a regular transaction, only to be rolled back later (e.g. when filling up gas I would have a first transaction for €150 and another one with the real price paid; the amount for the first one would be released back to my account or my card a week later). It took up to 7-10 days in some cases. I am not aware of any way to avoid this.
There's a legal minimun age to drive in Panama, but besides that some companies may have their own policies. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalpanama.com/Inicio/faq/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Rent a Car&lt;/a&gt; says the driver must be at least 23 years old and &lt;a href=&quot;http://car-rental.sixt.com/rental-service/conditiones-generales/?L=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sixt&lt;/a&gt; requires drivers to be at least 21 years of age.

About documentation you should have a passport and your country's drivers license (or the international drivers license). If you original license is written in a non-latin alphabet (arabic, cyrillic, e.g.) you must have the international one.
I am a doctor (neuroanaesthesiologist) working in reputed institute in Delhi and want to attend a conference in UK. I'm married, but have applied for divorce; however this is in the initial stages only. What should I write in marital status? Can I write separated even though I have no legal document to show I am indeed separated. Also I dont want to bring up the fact that a civil case is on, even though it has been filed by me.

Do you think my business academic visitors visa for attending conference in UK will be rejected on this basis? I have the requisite permissions and funding too.

The visitor form has several options for marital status...

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/IOrQC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

If you are still married, then select the option that indicates you are married. If you have a legal separation, select that one. You should then follow through in Part 4 where it asks &quot;&lt;em&gt;Does your spouse/partner currently live with you?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; 

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/dAISi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

...and answer it according to the current status at the time you apply. They don't care about separation unless you and your spouse are legally separated OR unmarried partners and the relationship has permanently broken down and that's not the case with you. 

They will not refuse on the grounds that you are having a separation or have filed for divorce.  In cases where a divorce has attracted lurid notoriety in the media, they &lt;em&gt;STILL&lt;/em&gt; do not refuse on that ground alone.

You can always go to Part 9 and provide a comment, but based upon what you have written, it's not necessary.

You may be over thinking it.  Answer the questions according to what the current status is on your application date.

I have a question about flying US Air internationally.  I am planning a trip with a return in June 2016.  The airline is not scheduling that far in advance and doesn't offer one way tickets.  This forces me to pay a $300 penalty to change my return flight.  Is there any other alternative?
The only other alternative is an &quot;open return&quot;, where you don't specify the return flight, essentially giving you an undated return ticket that you can book a light with later. You are usually paying a premium for open returns, and I would expect it to cost you #300 extra or more, so you probably aren't saving anything by going that route.
Can I still get passport stamps from Croatia (fly from EU country), Serbia (train from Croatia) and Romania (train from Serbia).

If not, can I still ask for a stamp in the border as souvenir?
Yes, you will get stamps. You will only not get stamps when travelling between Schengen countries. Croatia and Romania are not (yet) in the Schengen Area, and Serbia is not even in the EU (though there are non-EU Schengen countries, Serbia is not one of them).
My girlfriend and I are planning to go to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and had a few questions if anyone can help us!

What's the best place to fly (from Boston) into, if we want to minimize both flight price and driving distance to Yellowstone? I heard someone say that it's best to fly into Salt Lake City, as both flights and car rentals will be cheaper. Here's a quick breakdown of a few options we're considering, all based on the same travel dates and from the airport to the center of Yellowstone:


Salt Lake City: ~$500, 5 hour drive, ~$300 car rental
Billings: ~$500, 3 hour drive, ~$200 car rental
Cody: ~$600, 2 hour drive, ~$600 car rental
Bozeman: ~$500, 2 hour drive, ~$650 car rental


...so it really seems like Billings is the obvious choice. Am I missing something here?
For Croatia and Romania, it depends on your citizenship and possibly on your country of residence and a few other details but not really on where you are currently travelling from.

These two countries are EU member states and they &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; stamp EU passports (nor even require EU citizens from travelling with a passport, if they hold an ID card). I guess it's possible you could convince a border guard to stamp your EU passport anyway but in general they should not do it, no matter where you presently come from.

They are however not part of the Schengen area, which means they perform full border checks for land borders and incoming flights, even from EU or Schengen countries. The same rules therefore make it &lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt; to check EU passports/ID and stamp non-EU passports (except for the holders of some types of residence permits). Unlike the UK, which is mostly free to set its own rules, Croatia and Romania have to apply the Schengen rules and show they can perform border checks to the Schengen standard (even if they have not joined yet).

If and when Croatia or Romania finally join the Schengen area, they will lift border checks on land borders with other Schengen countries or flights originating from them but would still stamp the passports of third-country nationals coming from outside the Schengen area. The border between Croatia and Serbia or between Serbia and Romania would thus become the “external“ border of the Schengen area, which means checks for everybody and entry/exit stamps in the passports of non-EU citizens as applicable.

Serbia does whatever it likes, including stamping the passports of EU and non-EU citizens alike.
I am Nigerian and I applied for a UK visa, but was refused. I provided all the required documents ranging from bank statements to introduction letter from the company I work with to my tax card to flight/hotel reservation etc. Indeed I provided all the requirements they asked for. I applied for general visitor visa. The reason for being rejected is that they said I have no asset or property or strong family ties to prove that I will come back to my country.

Is it a crime for a single girl that has no asset or property to apply for visa and how would I have to prove to them that I have family ties here in Nigeria? Why on Earth would I leave my good paid job for an unsure circumstance in UK? I only want to go on vacation. I need advice on how to prove to them that I have strong family ties. I am an orphan from a family of 7 kids and I happen to be the last child. I have 11 nieces and nephews and a lot of cousins.
My middle name on my passport is missing one letter, so different from my ticket.  Will this be an issue? Doroty vs Dorothy
It's going to come down to culture, and income differential.

I've found that in countries where bartering is more common, then &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; touts are more persistent, as they can keep lowering prices and the like.

However, in other countries where you're the 'money on legs' to the locals, you may find more persistent 'bugging' or chasing down streets, because the payoff for them is huge.

In addition, when tourists are out of their comfort zone, their fears can be used or lack of knowledge taken advantage of, to elicit cash.  Overpriced taxi fares, a guide for the 'dangerous streets' and so on.

So in evaluating a country ahead of time, consider if it's generally a poorer country, a very different culture, and considered 'dangerous' by outsiders.  As a ROUGH (there are always exceptions and changes!!!) guide, that's an idea.

You can also search the internet for views of touts in the area, but generally more people post bad experiences than good experiences, so take them with a grain of salt.

Disclaimer: Not everyone has the same experience, and reading online will see arguments about how Mexico does or doesn't have bad touts, or how Moroccan ones will chase you down the street - but my description above comes from some experience.
I've gotten tickets thru them 2 out of 4 tries in the last 3 years. They found deals I had no idea were out there. Saved me 50% of the price and a better route as well. The other 2 times they didn't find anything better than I did so they assured me that they would refund the finder's fee without any hassles. They did this and told me it was standard policy to refund if they couldn't beat my price minus the finder's fee. So I didn't end up paying anything those times but was assuredly still on a good flight I found myself.

There still a small enough company that their service is quick and responsive. Go with them!
Most likely not a problem but at least in one case &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/passenger-refused-flight-over-missing-letter-on-airline-ticket-1.2891783&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Passenger refused flight over missing letter on airline ticket&lt;/a&gt; -- but the title is sensational if you read carefully all the airline said they can't guarantee the connecting airline won't have a problem.

This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k6217944-Wrong_spelling_of_middle_name-Air_Travel.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; reports a number of cases when this hasn't been a problem.

This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/7386078-post3.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; says 


  Turns out I've been flying with different middle names on my [driving licence] and passport for years. Tickets match passport, but I've often showed my DL and no one has batted an eye.


Summary: I would call the airline especially if you are connecting.
Currently planning a trip to see multiple cities in relatively close proximity. I expect to be travelling by land between them, so it does not matter so much which city I travel to and back from. It could be the same or a different one. The main concern is to find a good price.

What can I use to search for flights from a specific departure location to a set of cities simultaneously? I have been trying out combinations of cities, including various open jaw permutations, and dates and it is getting tedious.
Refusing entry based on &lt;strong&gt;nationality&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;stamps&lt;/strong&gt; is usual, but is there any state that refuses people based on their &lt;strong&gt;religion&lt;/strong&gt;?

As a counterexample, the official position of the Saudi government is now to &lt;a href=&quot;http://volokh.com/2011/06/23/delta-airlines-complicit-in-saudi-discrimination/&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; forbid Jews from Saudi.
Yes.  I recently visited Saudi Arabia, and on both the visa application and on the landing card it asks for religion.

Based on anecdotal evidence, answering &quot;Jewish&quot; will result in your visa being rejected, without a specific reason for rejection being given.  Answering &quot;atheist&quot; has also been stated by several people as being a reason for visa rejection, however again no specific reason is given for the refusal.

Saudi will also refuse entry if they have proof of travel to Israel, and to Israeli nationals so it fits all of your categories.
You can do this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://kayak.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kayak&lt;/a&gt;.  Select a round-trip flight, and in the second box (destination), you can enter multiple airport codes separated by commas, up to 4.  (You can also enter multiple airport codes in the origin box.)

For example, entering &quot;DEN&quot; and &quot;ORD,IND,DTW,CLE&quot; gave me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kayak.com/flights/DEN-ORD,IND,DTW,CLE/2015-07-11/2015-07-22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this list of results&lt;/a&gt; for flights from Denver to any of Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit or Cleveland, and returning to Denver.  By default it includes multi-airport itineraries (e.g. DEN-ORD paired with IND-DEN) but there is a checkbox in the results page for &quot;Depart/Return same&quot; which will exclude those itineraries, and only show you trips where you return from the same airport where you arrived (e.g. DEN-ORD can only be paired with ORD-DEN).  There are also checkboxes where you can turn some of your airports on or off.
I only have anecdotal evidence for you as a Croat who frequently travels with a foreign non-euro passport through ex-Yugo countries. On some of the land borders the agents get quite lazy and will literally just look at the outside of the passport and wave you through. These guys you can quite easily ask for stamp if they don't automatically do it (mime it if they don't speak English, they'll understand) but it will depend on the person you get. I get a stamp about 50% of the time. 

My experience with the airports however is that they always stamp.

As for Romania, I've never been so I can't give you any advice there.
My boyfriend and i are planning 10days trip to Italy. So basically he is sponsoring the trip. My bank account does not have sufficient amount. Also we are right now in two different countries. So is there a way to obtain Schengen visa by showing his bank balance along with a letter?
The answer is no. You can not return for 10 years if you over stayed for more than 12 months. You will need to apply for a new visa, have interviews to explain the situation. I went through a similar situation Got duped in to believing the man I was involved with would do the right thing, only to find out he was still married, I got sick and got stuck in the USA for 6 years.  Applying for a new visa is tough these days, but if the reason is legitimate, they might approve it. I asked to visit my employer but was refused.
I have booked flight from broker, flight is from Riga RIX to Goa GOI, now part of my trip has changed.


  3 9W2354H 24APR MAA GOI   1035  1315 (cancelled flight)   4 9W2305H

  6 9W 427H 05MAY GOI BOM    1855  2005  (cancelled flight)
  
  7 9W2374H 05MAY GOI BOM   0545  0700  (new flight)


Broker offers only partial refund (full price was 550 Eur)

We would like to inform you that unfortunately the airline company does not accept the request for full refund in case of cancellation so according the airline's rules your e-ticket fare is non-refundable. The refundable amount is 85.62 € for both passengers. This amount will be reimbursed within a maximum of 30 working days after the airline's authorization. For any change or cancellation our agency charges 30.00 €.

Now we prefer not to take a flight at all, may i ask a full refund because a part of booking has be changed?
Travelling from the UK to Spain, have lost passport, any ideas?
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikvoyage&lt;/a&gt; also lists Jackson Hole (JAC), West Yellowstone (WYS) and Idaho Falls (IDA) as possibilities.

I don't know your exact dates, so I can't tell you how much the flights will cost.
&lt;h3&gt;(Auto) Top-up Online&lt;/h3&gt;

Another option would be to avoid ticket machines and manned booths altogether. Once you purchase an Oyster card (with cash, so that your credit card won't be a problem), you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/oyster-online#on-this-page-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;top it up online&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/link/0004.do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;registering on Oyster Online&lt;/a&gt;, provided it is not a Visitor Oyster for which to date online top-up is not available. Even better you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/oyster-online#on-this-page-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;set-up Auto top-Up&lt;/a&gt; and never have to worry about manually topping-up. Once you are done travelling in London, you can cancel this service at no cost. Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/oyster-online#on-this-page-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TfL's FAQ on Auto top-up&lt;/a&gt;:


  &lt;h3&gt;Auto top-up&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  Auto top-up makes sure you never run out of pay as you go credit by automatically topping up your Oyster card with money from your credit or debit card, whenever your pay as you go balance falls below �10.
  
  Your card is automatically topped up when you touch your Oyster card on a yellow card reader at the start of a journey on bus, Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground or National Rail services in London.

As you are British, you are from the EU, and you only need a national identity card to enter the Schengen area (Spain in your case).

According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_the_Schengen_Area#Visa_exemptions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this good Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; on the Scengen visa policy, you should even &lt;a href=&quot;http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;amp;f=ST%2015010%202006%20INIT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;3.1.2, p23&quot;&gt;&quot;be afforded every reasonable opportunity to obtain the necessary documents or have them brought to them within a reasonable period of time or corroborate or prove by other means that he/she is covered by the right of free movement.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; &quot;checks on persons enjoying the Community right of free movement should be limited, as a general rule, to the verification of their identity and nationality.&quot;

In other words, you can go with your national ID (is your driver license your national ID?) or take all the documents you have (if no national id) including the receipt from the passport office stating you have lost and asked for a new passport. Explaining your situation, and given the wording used, there might not be any issue, at least, it is worth trying.

As @Relaxed mentioned, the problem may also come from the airline staff. While the border guard may allow you in, the airline staff may also require some specific ID documents. You should check your airline website what piece of ID is required. My opinion is that in the end you should still try to go and see.
I am an Indian Citizen and scheduled to visit Schengen countries during 04.04.2015 to 12.05.2015 and accordingly obtained Schengen Visa. I have applied for UK visa as a Tourist to visit London from Paris but due to time constraint I could not get the visa in time and today withdrawn the UK Visa application from UK embassy. I want to know if there any procedure so that I can apply UK visa from Paris on reaching there.
&lt;h2&gt;Which Embera Community?&lt;/h2&gt;

I believe there are several Embera communities (including but not limited to  Embera Drua (Upper Chagres), Embera Puru and Arimae), and hence various different places one can be picked up along the Chagres on the way to the village. Hence this question is kind of on the &lt;em&gt;broadish&lt;/em&gt; side according to TSE's regulations. Nevertheless I understand that finding information on the topic is quite challenging, and I assume that for the purpose of your question any information to privately reach any village will do. So here we go.

&lt;h3&gt;Visit Embera Drua&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nativeplanet.org/indigenous/embera/emberadrua.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This webpage from Native Planet&lt;/a&gt; explains how to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Embera+Drua+Villiage/@9.2611734,-79.5166399,1486m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x8fab4f019879841b:0x1cf3463f0eca88&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Embera Drua village&lt;/a&gt;. It suggests contacting the village to arrange a private visit. More importantly, &lt;strong&gt;it mentions a rendez-vous point on the lake, which I assume is Lake Alajuela, at Puerto El Corotu&lt;/strong&gt;. This might be the place you are looking for. 

As it turns out, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://trail2.com/embera/plan.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Embera Drua community has it's own website&lt;/a&gt;, with information on how to visit, and detailed instructions on how to reach Puerto El Corotu. Quoting from the website (emphasis mine):


  &lt;h2&gt;Driving Directions from Panama City&lt;/h2&gt;
  
  Take the Transístmica Highway to the community of Cabima. Or, to arrive quickly (and bypass city congestion), you can choose to take the Corredor Norte to the &quot;Colon / Las Cumbres&quot; exit, where you will end up again on the Transístmica.
  
  Then, continue north toward Colon on the Transístmica Highway for 6.8 kilometers to La Cabima. There, you will see a Super 99 grocery store, Mr. Precio and a Pío-Pío restaurant in a small shopping center on the right. 
  
  Turn right after the shopping center and pedestrian bypass. Immediately after turning, follow the road as it curves slightly to the left.
  
  Continue for 6.5 kilometers until you reach the Bayano Cement Factory (Cemento Bayano).
  Turn left at the factory’s sign marked &quot;Cemento Bayano.” 
  Continue on for 8 kilometers until you reach a green and yellow one-story building on your left.  This is the Panama National Environmental Agency (ANAM) station in Chagres National Park. 
  Pull in and register as a park visitor and pay a small entrance fee ($1 per person for Panamanians, $3 for others). 
  Exiting the station, turn left back onto the road. Follow this road to the lake. &lt;strong&gt;This is the port of Corotú.&lt;/strong&gt;  Welcome!
  
  You can park your car at the port securely. There is a police presence overseeing the port all day. 


Moreover, the website mentions the possibility of helping you arrange transport to Puerto el Corotu. Below are the contact details:

&lt;h3&gt;Google Maps Meeting Point&lt;/h3&gt;

Curiously enough, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Embera+Meeting+Point/@9.2220192,-79.5463426,743m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x8fab4fe4f83326d1:0x1ef6f32dd557c56d&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google maps has a pinpointed location called Embera Meeting Point&lt;/a&gt; which could also be interesting to you. It's difficult to say if this is Puerto El Corotu, or even if it is for charter boats alone, or which community will be picking you up here. Nevertheless it's still a valid clue in my opinion.
I have found that regardless of bag size AA will not allow any roller bags.
They will gate check.  

My computer bag is not small looking, but fits under the seat.
I have been with others whose bags are half the size of mine, but due to them having rollers, have been forced to gate check.

This is their policy and no measuring is considered.
I will be traveling to Amsterdam with elderly parents. They/we have a different &quot;comfort zone&quot; and would like to avoid walking through some liberal areas (such as the red light district or cannabis cafes) in Amsterdam. No disrespect meant to the Dutch, I applaud their liberal attitude but we aren't ready for it yet. We would like to experience a &quot;family friendly&quot; Amsterdam.

Is that at all possible? I would like to mark it all out on a map. I started doing that but all I have shaded off is the red-light area as suggested by google maps.
I am interested in doing a Master's degree in Sweden or Germany, and I was accepted for a program in Sweden, but for Germany, I expect decisions to come in in May and June. For me, Germany is preferable. I looked at the visa instructions and I have some concerns regarding the process. My situation is as follows:


For Sweden, if the process takes the longest time (3 months for the
decision + 4 weeks for the residence permit card), I will need to
have sent the visa application by April 25th. This includes paying a
portion of the fees. I can keep my place in university if I pay
before the 2nd of June, though.
For Germany on the other hand, I have to wait at least till May 15th
for some admission decisions to arrive. My concern is that, for the
visa, it is asked that my passport should be valid for beyond the
duration of the study, but my passport will expire before the second
year. I am not able to renew my passport till 6 months before
expiration. Is it a problem if I can't comply with this one
instruction?


If I stall applying for a Sweden visa, I may not make it in time for the program. I can have a chance if I apply before May 25th (best-case scenario). I am wondering if it is possible to proceed with the Sweden visa application and then, if I am accepted for a program in Germany, try for a Germany visa at the same time? 

Any info or advice would be appreciated. I plan also to try to ask the German consulate about the passport problem.

Some background: I am an Iraqi citizen living in Dubai. I was rejected UK student visa twice for my Bachelor's. 
Places selling cannabis (“coffeshops“) aren't restricted to a particular part of town and can't be avoided entirely (to be accurate, their locations are in fact regulated through a permit system and they are required, e.g., not to be too close from a school, but they are not restricted to one specific neighbourhood). On the other hand, there is not much to see apart from a sign, sometimes a bit of music or a smell for the larger ones. From the outside, many look more like a closed disco or café than anything else. It might not help if you find the very idea disturbing but it's very easy to just move on, or in many cases, not notice them at all.

Avoiding the red light districts (especially the larger one called “De Wallen“) would therefore be the most important. The one in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singel&quot;&gt;Singel area&lt;/a&gt; in particular is a bit surprising. Whereas you can “feel” you are getting closer to De Wallen (many neon lights, seedy shops, drunken tourists…) and avoid it easily, I once stumbled upon the other one while getting out of a car park. There were a few “windows“ in quiet tree-lined streets in a picturesque neighbourhood, not far from some upscale restaurants and a conference venue, which was a bit disconcerting.

More generally, the Netherlands have become (in)famous for their liberal approach to many things but at the end of the day, all of it is limited in scope, inconspicuous or easy to avoid. Putting things into perspective, the ads or street prostitution I occasionally came across in Germany seemed more obnoxious.
The Google Map of the Red Light Disrict is a bit misleading. It highlights the De Wallen district but in reality the majority of the &quot;windows&quot; are in a smaller area inside this district hugging Oudezijds Voorburgwal along the canal and in and around the De Oude Kerk church. 

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nkj5N.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

It can be hard to visit Amsterdam and not see the &quot;sights&quot; of legalised prostitution as there are other smaller areas where it is legal like the one in De Pijp which is along a street of apartments and bars.

However they are easily distinguishable by their neon red lights above windows and doors so they are easily avoidable if necessary. If you do happen to pass one of the windows though you will not see very much. In my experience they were generally empty or the black curtain was drawn.

Regarding the smoking of legalised cannabis these are much harder to avoid as they are present in all areas but confined to coffee shops. But as Relaxed mentioned they are very inconspicuous apart from the odd smell here or there.

There are lots of family friendly activities to do in Amsterdam. The rich architecture, history and art of the city to name a few. Enjoy your trip!
I'm in Dublin today, and I would like to know if it's there's a way to visit the Game of Thrones Tv show locations without pay for the tour (70EUR). That is possible to make the GoT tour by myself? And if yes, is a good choice to do that?
I'll answer specifically for the UK, implicitly for the EEA because there are intersecting regulations...

For reference purposes, the rule &lt;strong&gt;at the time this question was asked&lt;/strong&gt; was...


  does not intend to produce goods or provide services within the United
  Kingdom, including the selling of goods or services direct to members
  of the public; and


The rules have been changed &lt;em&gt;TWICE&lt;/em&gt; since then. This rule is no longer part of the current rules and is maintained only in archived form at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/archive-immigration-rules&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Archive: Immigration Rules&lt;/a&gt;. The text is important because some of the same language and concepts (intent) were carried forward into subsequent legislation.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/22/contents/enacted&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Immigration Act 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

The visitor rules were changed in the above act and became active in 2015. As a part of this change, the 'Permitted Activities List' was introduced. The relevant part of of the rule itself is in V 4.6...


  V 4.6 Permitted activities must not amount to the applicant taking
  employment, or doing work which amounts to them filling a role or
  providing short-term cover for a role within a UK based organisation.
  In addition, &lt;strong&gt;where the applicant is already paid and employed outside
  of the UK, they must remain so&lt;/strong&gt;. Payment may only be allowed in
  specific circumstances &lt;strong&gt;set out in V 4.7&lt;/strong&gt;.


And the relevant clause from V 4.7...


  V 4.7 The applicant must not receive payment from a UK source for any
  activities undertaken in the UK, except for the following:


&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/contents/enacted&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Immigration Act 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

This act added a new criminal offence for unlawfully working in the UK &lt;em&gt;if the person knew&lt;/em&gt; or had reason to believe that they were disqualified from working because of their immigration status.

The act further clarified what types of work were prohibited and includes entering into contracts to provide goods and services and entering into contracts to perform work as self-employed. The act specified that 'contracts' can be formal documents or verbal agreements. The act further allows the government to seize amounts in excess of �1,000 under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/contents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the broad redefinitions of 'work', the visitor rules themselves were not changed as a result of this act.

I want to go to Iceland during my spring break next year, but there isn't a lot of information on what trails are open for a multi-day hike. What is the best way (and how much am I looking at) for transportation to and from a trail head, and any recommendations for trails?
Yes, you will be able to apply for  a UK VISITOR visa in France.

The controlling reference is Paragraph 28 of the rules...


  An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United
  Kingdom and Islands at the time of the application. An applicant for
  an entry clearance who is seeking entry as a visitor must apply to a
  post designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for
  entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant.
  Subject to paragraph 28A, any other application must be made to the
  post in the country or territory where the applicant is living which
  has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications
  for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of
  applicant. Where there is no such post the applicant must apply to the
  appropriate designated post outside the country or territory where he
  is living.

The part about 'post designated by the Secreatry of State to accept...' refers in your case to the British Consulate-General in Paris. 

Note that the rule explains that it works for VISITOR applications only.  Other types of applications, like work and family applications are not covered by this rule.  Work and family applications must be applied for in the county where you have established residence.

In order to apply you need to create an account at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visa4uk.fco.gov.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Visa4UK&lt;/a&gt;.  You will also need to enrol your biometrics at a French station.  

&lt;h2&gt;Update 3 September 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

The rules changed in April 2015 and Paragraph 28 (quoted above) is no longer the controlling reference point.  Everything is still the same, but they moved parts of Paragraph 28 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/449641/20150803_Immigration_Rules_-_Appendix_V.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Appendix V&lt;/a&gt; of the rules.

After some researching myself, I have come up with some of my own finds.

The &lt;strong&gt;The Eureka&lt;/strong&gt; locomotive from the old &lt;strong&gt;Eureka and Palisade Railroad&lt;/strong&gt; seems to sometimes run on the &lt;strong&gt;Durango and Silverton&lt;/strong&gt; line.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Hyiu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

There is also the &lt;strong&gt;Virginia and Truckee 22 Inyo&lt;/strong&gt; locomotive which runs / ran on the &lt;strong&gt;Virginia and Truckee Railroad&lt;/strong&gt; - Which I believe is the train of my first picture in my question :D

I'm from Montreal (Quebec). I went on vacation in California 5 years ago and got pulled over for speeding on the highway in a rental car (111 mph in a 60 mph zone).

The officer told me I was lucky he didn't simply suspend my licence and impounded the car. He saw I wasn't from around here and decided to let me go with a citation asking to show up to court. I was going back to Canada a few days later so couldn't show up on the specified date.

Back home, I called the court house in California asking what to do. They told me that I should hand write a letter to the judge explaining that I can't show up to court because I live in Canada and had other obligations. I wrote that letter, completely admitting to my guilt and apologizing, and asked whether there was another way of settling this than showing up to court.

I got a letter a few weeks later asking me to pay a fine of about US$1600. I wanted to pay but didn't have the money at the time. I neglected to contact them again to ask for a payment plan of some sort, and never received another letter or communication.

I haven't set foot in the USA again since that time, until now. I'm planing on going back but in Miami, FL (not California). Will I have trouble at the border? I'm going there by plane so I will land in New York first, then take another flight to Miami. I'm not planning to rent a car or drive.

What are the chances of me getting arrested? Is it automatically jail time or can I just pay the fine and leave? Do you think my &quot;driving history file&quot; from California can be pulled up/will show up on the computers in New York or Miami customs?

From my understanding, California doesn't have any reciprocal agreement with Quebec. Is that correct? For what it's worth, I haven't gotten any demerit points on my driver's licence.
There are no official laws in any country, not even in Saudi Arabia (asked a friend from Saudi Arabia) that blindly refuse entry based on your religion, if you follow any. 

However, your religion can affect how your visa applications are processed. 

The most famous case is when a Jewish person tries to visit an Islamic country, or when an Islamic person tries to enter Israel. In almost all cases, visa applications are refused. But I could not find any official reference to it. 

If you go beyond tourism, there are lots of laws based on the religion. 

Getting permanent residency or citizenship, or when you apply for a work permit or such visa, there are many countries that take your religion into account. 

Pakistan: you must be Islamic if you want to settle down. Even the Islam has divisions, and some of them are not considered. 

Japan: it's very difficult (if not impossible) to settle down in Japan if you are a Muslim. Update: It seems I was wrong in this. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turning-japanese.info/2013/10/can-muslims-acquire-japanese.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Jewish -&gt; Islam issues. If you have an entry seal from Israel, you will be denied entry to Kuwait. Egypt and Jordan (neighboring countries) have some agreements and do allow visitors. But Kuwait and Saudi Arabia: No. 

I can't even remember filling out visa forms that asked my religion. Unless it's an edge case, you should be fine. However, note that practicing religion while you are inside a country is sometimes frowned upto and it can be illegal too. There are some stories coming out from Middle East that punished a foreign Buddhist labor for owning a lord Buddha statue. 
I can recall a very similar question, and being a single male with nobody depending on me, I can share the same experience. 

The flight bookings, hotel reservations, and bank statements all prove that you have enough funds to spend during your stay. This is, however, only a part of you that they evaluate. 

Single people with a lot of freedom to move to a different country are high-risk people. People visiting a country on a tourist visa and staying there happens more often that you think. I do not want to emphasize on a certain nation, but there was a nice documentary about such people in the UK. 

You need to understand that it's nothing personal or any fault in you. It's just that they see anyone with such characteristics as high risk. 


If you are still studying, mention that in your application. If you have a degree that you have to complete, that is generally considered a tie to your home country. 
Long term lease, long term job contracts, and anything like that basically proves that you are purely visiting the country for tourism can increase your chance too. 


If your passport is new, with 0 or only a few visa/entry seals, that is a red flag for them too. A person outside the EU taking their first trip to UK: kinda alarming isn't it? 

Make up your mind, and visit some neighboring countries first. The older your passport is, more convincing it is in their eyes that you really have the traveling spirit. 

You can also try as an organized tour, but that is no way to travel (just my opinion). I wish you good luck! 
&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: Probably not, but I still wouldn't risk it&lt;/strong&gt;

A speeding ticket is a traffic infraction and not a criminal offence; however, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.occourts.org/self-help/infraction/failuretoappearandwarrants.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;failing to show up for your court date is a misdemeanor&lt;/a&gt; and you have likely been issued with a bench warrant.  These are state-level warrants and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawqa.com/qa/will-state-extradite-for-bench-warrant-for-failure-to-appear-for-dui-charges&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; states do not extradite for misdemeanors&lt;/a&gt;, since that would require California to foot the bill for extraditing you from Florida, although there are exceptions (Nevada is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/usa/1126853-unpaid-speeding-ticket-texas-arrest-warrant-issued-uk-citizen-implcations.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;apparently notorious&lt;/a&gt; for extraditing even for parking offenses).  And if there's no nationwide warrant, it's unlikely that your offence would show up on Immigration's computers.

All that said, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://london.usembassy.gov/root/visa-wizard/pages/visawizard008a.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;US government's official advice&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of the US embassy in London, is as follows:


  If a traffic offense occurred while you were in the United States, and
  you have an outstanding fine against you, or if you did not attend
  your court hearing, &lt;strong&gt;it is possible there may be a warrant out for your
  arrest and you will experience significant problems when applying for
  admission at the U.S. port of entry&lt;/strong&gt;.


So even if the odds of getting busted as low, given the amount of pain that would ensue if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; busted, &lt;strong&gt;the right thing is to contact the court house and pay your fine, which is also the only way to make sure this issue is permanently sorted out.&lt;/strong&gt;  Even if you get away with it on this trip, what are you going to do when you suddenly need to go to California some day and rent a car?
Have you heard of PT? &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_traveler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_traveler&lt;/a&gt;

Who says you can't work online for your home country while on a 90 days visa free stay in Chile, Brazil, etc?

The whole point concerns tax. AS you already pay tax in your home country and do not stay more that 180 days a year in one country, you are considered not resident for tax purposes. Check expat forum and the laws in each country. In general any country where you can stay visa free less than 6 months is good. An you being an American, you are the only citizen in the world, apart from Eritreans, that pays tax based on nationality, so even if you wanted not to pay US tax, you could only do that by renouncing your US citizenship.

You would not be arrested by the U. S. Customs and Border Protection inspectors...


  No Federal statute authorizes an arrest by a Federal law enforcement
  officer based on an outstanding state warrant. Federal officers making
  such an arrest are arresting either as a peace officer or a citizen
  depending on the law of the state in which the arrest is made.


Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://shusterman.com/pdf/cbpinspectorsfieldmanual.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://shusterman.com/pdf/cbpinspectorsfieldmanual.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

And they only swear out peace officers in the state they operate in as a Federal officer.  Your warrant (if there is one) is in California and you are landing in NYC.  Different state entirely.  If you get stopped on the road in Florida, the police will then know about the warrant (if there is one). They will not arrest you on behalf of California, but because you have absconded, you're off to the nick (detention) until you pay whatever fine you incur in Florida.

And of course if some chance (a la White Nights) diverts a flight you are on to California, well... say hello to Bubba.  There is no statute of limitations on a bench warrant.

I am also a random person on the net whose knowledge of matters arising under U. S. law is amateur in the most generous of lights.  
I am flying United Airlines to Melbourne from O'Hare (same ticket). There is a 1 hour 10 minute layover between my ORD-LAX and LAX-MEL flights.

Is this enough? 

My research so far on this:


My ORD-LAX flight is United. So, I guess it should arrive at Terminal 8. I checked FlightAware and it seems that my LAX-MEL flight also takes off from Terminal 7 (Not TBIT). 
Terminal 7 and 8 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;seem to be connected&lt;/a&gt;
I have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; checked baggage. Just a backpack. 
Since ORD seems to be weather sensitive, this trip is in first week of May so hopefully, weather-related delays shouldn't occur (?). 

Fortunately you won't have to worry much since it's all on the same ticket.  If you can't make it they should rebook you.

However, from my experience through the hell that is LAX (albeit different terminals), you may need to move fast.  It's certainly possible, but if there's a bunch of planes at the same time that need to go through some line, that may slow you down.

Checked luggage likely wouldn't matter anyway as it'd be checked through to MEL.
I'm writing a thriller novel set in modern-day Vietnam. I need my protagonist, who's wanted for murder,  to sneak illegally across the border from Vietnam to Cambodia.

Where are the most porous border areas between these two countries where people are believed to slip across most easily?
70 minutes is plenty of time - if your inbound flight is on time.

Almost all United flights - including ALL domestic flights - arrive into terminal 7 or 8, and all departing United flights leave from those same terminals.  These terminals are connected airside, and there is no additional security or outbound immigration you need to pass through.  Worst case your two gates will be about a 10 minute walk apart. Boarding for international flights closes 15 minutes before departure, so you've got 40+ minutes from landing which is plenty.

However, personally I would never book this connection.  The issues isn't how easy the connection is to make, it's the impact if you don't make it - such as if your inbound flight is delayed.  United only runs one flight to Melbourne each day, so if you mis-connect they will book you on the same flight the next day.  There's no chance of getting on another airline, as they all leave around the same time so you'll have missed those as well!

If the cause of the delay was their fault (eg, mechanical issue) then they will provide a hotel, but if it was outside of their control (weather, ATC delays, etc) then you (or your travel insurance?) be up for the cost of the hotel.

If you want to risk a 24 hour delay, book this connection.  If not, book an earlier flight from Chicago - one with at least 2 hours between flights.
According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://tuoitrenews.vn/features/17003/in-photos-smuggling-goods-at-vietnamcambodia-border-gate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; 


  Ta Mau is believed to be the largest hotspot for smugglers in the Mekong Delta region.
  Multiple types of products in large numbers are gathered and classified by day at the Vietnam-Cambodia border gate and are piled into boats and smuggled into Vietnam at night. 

&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to a real life lawyer. They will need more exact information than you provide here, so see other steps noted below for how to get that info so you don't waste your/their time.

&lt;strong&gt;Reasons:&lt;/strong&gt; You may have been charged with criminal speeding, or you may (and this is relatively likely) have a warrant for you for failure to appear, contempt of court, failure to pay, or any one of about a half-dozen other things. You may indeed have multiple such items issued, depending on the exact way the ticket was written and the temperament of the judge in the city/county that handles these matters...also, depending on the astronomical alignment of the stars. Our legal systems aren't known for their predictability.

&lt;strong&gt;Other Possible Steps, beyond lawyer (but not a replacement!):&lt;/strong&gt; Call around to get in touch with the courthouse in the area where you were given the ticket, and ask to speak to someone about an old speeding ticket. After some transfers you should be able to get to the right courthouse/department and they can look up your ticket, give you the status, and also helpfully tell you if there is a warrant issued for your arrest in the case. There may not be - but there may be. I wouldn't be afraid of this part - the FBI will not descend on your house for calling the court, nor will the court suddenly &quot;remember&quot; the ticket and go after you. You're pretty darn safe to call and ask.

You can also Google around for the US county you received the ticket and check out their website. Often you can just enter your name and birthdate and search for old tickets, warrants, fines, etc - but this varies by county and state.

&lt;h2&gt;Why Not Just Go For it?&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1769/kw/Entering%20US%20with%20a%20misdemeanor&quot;&gt;You can be denied entry to the US&lt;/a&gt;. While in no way a guarantee, nor even particularly likely, this can change at any time and there are no promises made. If you are denied entry I imagine this would ruin your vacation plans, so you do have the option to file an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-192.pdf&quot;&gt;I-192 Application For Advance Permission To Enter as Nonimmigrant&lt;/a&gt;, so they'll let you know if you can even enter the country.
You can be denied permission to drive. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmvflorida.org/drivers-license-nc.shtml&quot;&gt;Did you want to drive in Florida?&lt;/a&gt;
If originally granted permission to drive initially, there is no guarantee the ticket will be &quot;seen&quot; during the permission granting. During a routine traffic stop you could find out that you are not, in fact, allowed to drive, and you can be arrested on the spot and/or fined for driving without legal authorization.
Even if you don't drive, if for any reason you have a talk with the authorities and they notice an out of state warrant, the idea that this won't be a problem for you is simply wrong - the standard procedure is to go ahead and arrest you and take you to the local jail. You may not be extradited to California if they don't want to pay, but California doesn't have to decide that right away - you can easily spend a minimum of a business day in jail, and depending upon local laws and conditions this could be an entire weekend or longer even if you are a naturalized US citizen. How long you might be in a jail as a non-citizen could vary quite a bit. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/out-of-state-arrest-warrants.html&quot;&gt;one legal site&lt;/a&gt;:



  According to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and many
  comparable state rules, an arrest based on a valid warrant can be
  executed anywhere in the United States. Whether or not that arrest
  will occur, however, simply depends.



Technically speaking, yes you could also be allowed to enter the US and then arrested once you get to immigration or beyond. We're not talking SWAT-team action here - just a casual glance at a screen that shows you have outstanding warrant(s) in a US state. While our legal systems are not the most modern in the world, the growth and sharing of databases has exploded in the past few years and it would be foolish to think old ways of doing things are permanent.


&quot;You'll probably be fine&quot; is rightfully considered on the same level of wisdom as behavior that generally follows someone saying &quot;hold my beer&quot; - it is almost never worth the risk. Sure, you might be fine - but you might also be in for a really, really unpleasant experience. And don't take my word for it - talk with a legal professional before you bet on relying on the kindness and/or complacency of the US legal system.

Again, as a lifetime citizen of the US and someone who lived 20+ years in Florida, I urge you to speak with a professional on this matter, if for no other reason than peace of mind so you can enjoy your vacation (and know if you need to cancel it!). If you were a citizen of the USA I would still urge you to do this, and as an &quot;alien&quot; this is a no brainer - talk with a professional first!
Re filling out ESTA - I am flying into the US staying 2 days then flying onto Rome tthen returning 6 weeks later for 4 nights then flying home to NZ. On the form do I say yes to transit or no?
You're staying two days in the country, so that's not a transit.  You're exiting the airport (I assume you're not staying two days in the airport!) and visiting the US.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/WebHelp/ESTA_Screen-Level_Online_Help_1.htm#ta8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;From the ESTA help page&lt;/a&gt;:


  &lt;strong&gt;Do nationals or citizens of countries that participate in the Visa
  Waiver Program require travel authorization if they are only
  transiting the United States en route to another country?&lt;/strong&gt;
  
  Eligible
  nationals or citizens of countries that participate in the Visa Waiver
  Program require either a travel authorization or a visa to transit the
  United States. If a traveler is only planning to transit through the
  United States en route to another country, when he or she completes
  the travel authorization application in ESTA, the traveler should
  select &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Is your travel to the US occurring in
  transit to another country?&quot;.

As usual, lots of fake/spam sites when trying to Google this. And also information that is out of date, applies to other nationalities only, or applies to getting the visa in another location.

Often there are different rules for applying for a visa depending on your nationality, or on which embassy or consulate in which country you apply to.

I also believe that the requirements for a &lt;strong&gt;multiple-entry&lt;/strong&gt; visa may be more stringent than for a single- or double-entry visa, depending on your nationality.

&lt;strong&gt;I want to know what documents I need to take to make my visa application in Saigon, Vietnam, in 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;

I obtained a double-entry visa just over a year ago in Vientiane, Laos and only needed a passport photo and printouts showing one flight in and out of China and one hotel booking. A travel agent in Vientiane booked, printed, and cancelled those for me for $3. I didn't have to book anything for the second visit.

I believe I may have to show that I've visited twice before to be eligible for a multiple entry visa. I have a new passport since those visits and did not bring my old passport. Is it up to me to provide evidence of my previous visits or do they just check my records? Will I at least need the dates?


What is the current price?
How long does it take?
What do I need to provide?

It sounds like your single protagonist is trying to slip through alone, without being seen at all? One would presume that the best area for this would be as deep in the bush as possible, so far from big cities on either side. 

You could take a page from actual news: Montagnard refugee groups are hiding in the jungle along the northern part of the border (Ratanakiri province),  and apparently have been doing so (relatively) successfully for at least the last few months. They're fleeing Vietnamese authorities, so it's in the direction you're interested in; though that's not to say that the Cambodian authorities have a positive opinion of them either. Take a look at Radio Free Asia (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rfa.org/english/news/social/140448-20040707.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/exposure-01272015160837.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) or the Jakarta Post (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/01/20/14-vietnamese-montagnards-hiding-cambodian-jungle-rights-group.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) for more information.

You might also want to research North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong tactics during the US-Vietnam war in the 1960s-70s. They regularly crossed over the border in the north to move supplies or forces southward and then back into South Vietnam. This would be more in the vein of finding lesser or un-monitored points and/or bribing border officials, at least for larger movements of materiel. 
We just had a problem leaving London Heathrow. The AlItalia check-in would not allow us to leave without a ticket which showed we were leaving Brazil, even though we had a flight booked out of Peru within the three month period. It meant we had to buy a plane ticket out of Brazil before we checked in. 
I have to take a business trip to Berlin. My company offices are &lt;a href=&quot;http://europarc.de/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I'll probably stay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-berlin-kurfurstendamm?_ga=1.49868578.560078807.1426687915&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in an hotel in Kurf�rstendamm&lt;/a&gt;, just to be in a &quot;center&quot; location.

Can you guys suggest me a public transportation route from that address to the Europarc?
Well, the Kurf�rstendamm or Ku'Damm is quite long. Depending on where you're staying the route might differ. But here are two examples:

If you're near the west end of Ku'Damm, take the &lt;em&gt;Ringbahn (S41)&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;S Halensee&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;S Westkreuz&lt;/strong&gt; and change for the &lt;em&gt;S7&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Take the S7 (from &lt;strong&gt;S+U Bhf Zoologischer Garten&lt;/strong&gt; if staying in that region) to &lt;strong&gt;S Wannsee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
From S Wannsee, take the &lt;em&gt;620 Bus&lt;/em&gt; directly to Europarc.

This trip covers all three &quot;zones&quot; A, B, and C, so you might want to consider this when buying tickets.

If you consider taking a cab, the calculated price would be between 30 and 35 EUR. But since Europarc Dreilinden is in Brandenburg (not Berlin), prices are negotiable and might be higher.

This is an emergency. I want to visit my nephew who has been admitted to a Manchester, England hospital where he is on life support equipment. I live in Canada where I am a permanent resident. Nobody is helping me and I don't know where to turn for help. It is so stressful for me.  

Can someone help me please?
As other posters have said, failure to show up for your traffic infraction is a &lt;b&gt;misdemeanor&lt;/b&gt; which will not prevent your entry into the United States. That said, there most likely is a &lt;b&gt;bench warrant&lt;/b&gt; issued for your appearance in court in California and &lt;b&gt;they will arrest you in California&lt;/b&gt;. This will not cause you problems getting a license in Florida unless they have &lt;b&gt;reciprocity&lt;/b&gt; with California, which is unlikely. Adjacent states like NY, NJ and CT have reciprocity agreements. 

The United States was formed when suspicion of Federal power was at its height. After the revolutionary war, states wanted authority over their own affairs and did not honor warrants from other states prima facia. As other posters have mentioned, even today an extradition hearing is required to make you appear in California and that will only be carried out for Felonies. 

As other posters have said, your best bet is to take care of your problem in California. You don't want some computer deciding that because the moon is full, wine is red and you have a warrant in California that you belong on the no fly list.

Its too bad you already plead guilty. You should have researched the posted fine for your speed first. In some states you could have at least plead no contest and kept your mouth shut about your guilt. This would have left more room for determining the fine. Here's a long shot: Ask them for a new court date so that you can change your plea. Request a supporting deposition. Go to traffic school in Canada, if possible print out your clean record at your DMV or get a cop to do it. Then send this information to the California court. Tell them you would like to settle this matter while you have some money to do it rather than risk not being in the US for your new court date. Thank them for considering your request. They will probably laugh and send you a letter with your new surcharges for failure to appear. But you might get lucky and get a 50% reduction if it is a small town. If so, pay it right away.

People may think my advice will fail, and it surely will in the city where they hear every story all the time. But I was once hormone filled and wild. I had stacks of tickets and knew every trick possible to get out of them. I leave you with 2 stories that show that the judges have the power to do what they want, so respect them. Once I was following another guy going 81 in a 55. The cop let the other guy go because he was a cop and he flagged me down seconds later. I couldn't afford the fine so I went to a small town to see the judge. A nice old lady opened the door to the waiting area. That old lady was the judge. I asked her for a reduction in fine. She fined me 85 dollars and sent me on my way. Another time my wife was hit for 73 in a 55. She just got off the thruway and the speed dropped. We both showed up and another small town judge knew right away what happened since its like their big speed trap. He let it be reduced an 1110a and even apologized for the mandatory surcharge. He probably regretted that the state had the power to tell him he needs to apply the surcharge without his discretion.  

Respect the judges. They have the power to do what they want. Know your rights - its a form of respect for our laws. If you could show up you would get a supporting deposition and always try to show up and ask for a dismissal if they fail to provide it. At a minimum, you would make a deal with the prosecutor. Since you can't show up, you fight how you can - which is to delay and don't give up. They want your money and will take half - you just have to probe the system until you figure out how to give it to them. Finally, I had forgotten about an out of state ticket that hung around for 20 years. The town gave it to a collection agency who contacted me. I confirmed with the town this was legit and I paid about 50% and settled the ticket. They want your money. Your leverage is that you are not a resident so they have little to no recourse. Seek resolution and you will probably find it.

Hopefully you were driving at what you thought was a safe speed. If not you never know when lightning strikes and when it does you can't take back what you caused. I have calmed down and have no tickets in 15 years so my advice is probably outdated. Good luck, eh?
I tried once to invite family members with an Invitation + &quot;Verpflichtungserklaerung&quot; and the visa was denied (sorry don't remember the exact reason).

Instead my family members applied for a &quot;Tourist Visa&quot;. Here they had to get a Hotel reservation. I got a booking.com Reservation with &quot;Free Cancellation&quot; and canceled the reservation after the Visa was granted. 

My family members reported that when applying for tourist visa the process was a lot easier and the interviewer at the consulate were less suspicious and  more friendly. 

So if the financial situation of your family allows applying for a tourist visa I suggest taking that route.

  &quot;Emergency procedures will only apply to applications in rare situations. The guidelines are very specific regarding what is an emergency.
  
  These reasons are:
  
  • Illness or death of an immediate family member (immediate family members are the applicant's mother, father, brother, sister, husband, wife, son, or daughter).&lt;br&gt;
  • Emergency medical treatment which includes any persons needing to travel for support (such as a parent caring for an ill child).
  
  There are 4 steps to submit an emergency visa application for the UK.
  Read the visa application guidance on this website and submit your online application.
  
  Once an online application form has been fully completed, email your online application reference, which starts with GWF005******** to visqry.newdelhi@fco.gov.uk.
  , marked 'emergency application request'. Your email should explain why the application is eligible for emergency submission.
  
  On receipt of this information the UK Border Agency will assess whether the application meets the criteria and if eligible, the applicant will be given appointment details so they can submit their application at the visa application centre.
  
  All applications will be subject to mandatory checks which will take at least 24 hours to complete. Actual processing times will depend on the unique circumstances of the case.&quot;

Google Maps actually allows you to save maps and use them while you don't have WiFi. &lt;a href=&quot;http://maphappy.org/2015/01/how-to-enable-offline-maps-in-the-google-maps-app/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; outlines exactly how to do it, you basically save a map of wherever you'd like.

I am a national of a country under the Visa Waiver Program. I think that if I enter by air, I need to fill an ESTA form. If I enter by car, I don't need one, I can fill a form when crossing the border.

Winterfell was actually filmed in two locations, Castle Ward in Northern Ireland for the majority of the filming, and Doune Castle in Scotland for the pilot episode.

It's only an hour's drive south east from Belfast. There aren't any other useful ways to get there other than the tours themselves.

I'm Canadian and I want to know what my options are of booking a one-way ticket in Paris without a printer &amp;amp; how to actually get the physical ticket in hand. What are the most efficient &amp;amp; wallet-friendly options? 

Edit: I must say I have never done the e-ticket process &amp;amp; my phone dies too quickly. I don't want to depend on my phone. What are the other options? How does the e-ticket process work at the CDG?
Very few airlines issue paper tickets these days. You can walk up to the counter with wad of money and get one, but that's really not wallet friendly.

You can easily book online and get a confirmation number and an e-ticket number as your receipt. Doing this at least a week or two ahead of flying will increase the chances of getting a cheap ticket. On flying day you can check in online or at the airport. At the airport you can walk up to the kiosk put in your confirmation number and the kiosk will print your boarding pass. Since it's international travel you may have to go to the bag drop off to have your travel documents verified. If you don't like the kiosk you can go to check in counter and have a real person check you in and print your boarding pass. It just takes longer. Details depend somewhat on the airline. 
I'm an American living in Canada.

11 years ago, when I was 19, I was stupid and had some pot in my car while driving through a border patrol checkpoint. (&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; A border patrol checkpoint is not the same as a border crossing. A border patrol checkpoint is well-within the US; it is run by border patrol agents, not customs agents.) Long story short, the police dogs found the pot and I was issued a misdemeanor ticket for possession, which required a fee of $300.

Since then, every time I enter the US from abroad (which happens several times a year), the US customs agents give me a hassle about my &quot;drugs at the border event&quot;, as they put it, and invariably pull me and my family aside and search through all my things. It's not only embarrassing, but it adds anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours to my travel time, which makes catching planes tough.

Is there any way I can clean my record of this offense, so that I don't get pulled over every time I enter the US?

&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarification: I was not arrested. At the time of the incident, the border patrol agent issued me two tickets (on a standard &quot;traffic citation&quot; form): one for &quot;possession of marijuana&quot; and one for &quot;possession of paraphanalia&quot;. After he wrote up the tickets, he let me drive away. The tickets said I was to appear in magistrate court some time later. Instead, I opted to send via snail mail a check and a letter stating that I plead no contest to the tickets. (In hindsight, this may have not been the best move. Did I mention I was young and stupid?)
Here are a few apps I have found which work offline by allowing you to download maps with regular updates. All you need is a GPS enabled android phone to install these apps and your phone will replace the regular GPS device many people use. They also provide maps to most countries, though it would be advisable to check for map accuracy before using the apps outside USA. Each one of them, except Navigon, is either free or freemium. I have used Maps.me and Here; both are pretty good.

One of the requirements for the Schengen visa is for the applicant to present confirmed travel arrangements, most commonly air travel.  This is usually done by booking a ticket and printing out the confirmation.

On this occasion however, the 'host' owns a Gulfstream G650 and wants to pick up his guest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gorodperm.ru/en/&quot;&gt;Perm&lt;/a&gt; and return with her to Rome.  After a proper visit in Rome, he intends to return to Perm where she will alight.  What should he provide the applicant with in order to meet the Schengen requirement?  Neither host nor guest has done this before so there's no experience to rely upon.

Yes, it's possible to purchase tickets from a commercial airline and then to abandon them once the visa has been issued, and this option has been discussed and summarily discarded as a 'waste of money'. 

It's also possible to use Acrobat or Photoshop to mock up a confirmation, but this idea has also been discarded as 'tawdry'.

The host could also send his flight plan that he will file, but this will be in the future and it's indefinite (especially the return trip).  Also, he could send a copy of the registration papers, but this would not indicate anything other than ownership.

She cannot simply write &quot;arrangements have been made&quot; because they would need to see something.  The form says &quot;&lt;em&gt;State who and how and present corresponding
 documentation&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, but nothing more informative is given about the documentation.  What should the applicant enclose with her Schengen application that will demonstrate her capacity to travel when a conventional air confirmation is not appropriate?

The first option is being held in reserve as a last resort.
I wish to apply for a working holiday visa for France. One of the requirements in order to get the visa is:

&quot;Compulsory one-year health insurance (covering
all risks of sickness, maternity, disability and
repatriation) regardless of the travel plans or
intended length of stay decided by the
applicant.&quot;

I asked the consulate what one year exactly constitutes, and their reply was that the insurance must last from the date of your flight, until the same date the next year (ie 3rd of April 2015 to 3rd of April 2016). When including the fact next year is a leap year, that means you need 367 days of insurance. 

However, none of the travel insurance I've been looking at will go over 365 days. What can I do? Thanks.
While there are no guarantees, you can always file a claim for redress under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbp.gov/travel/customer-service/dhs-inquiry-program&quot;&gt;DHS TRIP program (Traveler Redress Inquiry Program)&lt;/a&gt;.

This program is intended for people who, among other things, are:


  
  Denied or delayed airline boarding;
  Denied or delayed entry into and exit from the United States at a port of entry; or
  Continuously referred to secondary screening.
  


After you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhs.gov/trip&quot;&gt;file a claim&lt;/a&gt;, you are supposed to be contacted within 30 days to submit any supporting documents. If you have any relevant documentation, be sure to have it ready.

In particular, I would suggest you have a criminal history check going back for the last 11 years from both the U.S. and Canada (since you are resident there) showing you have a clean record since the last time you were arrested for marijuana. You can obtain these from:


Canada: Obtain a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cr-cj/index-eng.htm&quot;&gt;Criminal Record Check&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/&quot;&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt;. Also obtain a criminal record check from your local police department in the province and city where you live and any other provinces you have lived for this time period.
United States: Obtain an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks&quot;&gt;Identity History Summary Check&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fbi.gov/&quot;&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;. Also obtain a criminal record check from the state police in any U.S. state where you have lived for this time period.


Since these can take several weeks to process, I also suggest gathering these records &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; filing your TRIP redress claim.
My family and I already have a UK visitor visa and confirmed return tickets back to India.  

I want to apply for Schengen visas for our entire party. We want to travel through the Schengen area various times during our stay in the UK with my sister's family (she is a British citizen.)  

We would need multiple-entry visas as we plan to visit various Schengen areas during the weekends. I am confused about how to apply. Will it be sufficient to show 5 to 7 days hotel booking in France and a return ticket to India for the multiple entries while asking for around 30 days for the Schengen visa. We are staying in the UK for 10 weeks total.
I am a student and I have to go to Italy for a conference in mid-May for a week. Then I have to go to Germany for another conference in late September for a week. A Schengen visa is valid for 90 days only, so how will I manage going to Germany if I use my visa in May for Italy?
Sounds like you're out of luck if you don't have private transport.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=fr&amp;amp;u=http://fr.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Parc_national_de_l%27Ichkeul&amp;amp;prev=search&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Only the French Wikivoyage&lt;/a&gt; seems to have anything on the site itself, and it's basically empty, so I went hunting for past reviews or blogs.

As a result, there's an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g293753-d324439-r239239950-Ichkeul_National_Park-Tunisia.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review on tripadvisor on the park&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately....


  You may think that the park is difficult to reach, this is not true.
  Fact is there is no public transport to it but to get there from
  Tunis, it is an easy two to two and a half hour drive. Bonus is the
  road is excellent, well paved and the scenery is great too. You feel
  like driving in southern France.


So no, there's no public transportation, but walking is probably out of the question :( You're going to need your own or someone else's vehicle.
I'm collecting places where I could taste and buy tea in China during my trip. Currently I have Beijing, Xian,Shanhai, HK on my road map, but if you have information about good and not scam tea in other cities, please let me know.

I'm interested in middle price level Phuer, Oolong and White Tea. 
I will try to visit northern China and/or eastern Russia on this trip.

I've visited South Korea many times and I'm really interested in the plight of North Koreans trying to flee from the repressive regime in the their country.

Which spots on the border are known for escapes? I know I've seen documentaries and news stories on it but don't know if they said where.

Actually even if I don't see anybody going for it it would still feel amazing to be at a place where I know people do often attempt this amazing personal challenge to find their freedom.

Is there somewhere near Weihai perhaps?
You're likely out of luck.  Generally, Russia requires you apply for a visa (and needs an invitation as well) from your country of citizenship OR country of residence.

If you're not applying at the embassy/consulate in your home country, you have to prove (visa or otherwise) that you're a resident in the third party country.

Getting an invite is easy enough, there are websites that do that for you, but to get it all in one day - no, and to get the visa from a non-residence country - unlikely, unless you can find a specialist visa agency who can pull some strings, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vhs-germany.com/contacts/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VHS in Germany&lt;/a&gt;.
A Schengen visa isn't necessarily or usually valid for 90 days. It's often limited to a specific number of days of stay over a given period.

If the visa is also a multiple-entry visa, you can use those days as you see fit, e.g. staying a few days in Italy for your conference, going back to your country of residence (or, at least, out of the Schengen area) for some time and then coming back to the Schengen area for the conference in Germany.

But if the visa says “90 days” in the “duration of stay” field, it actually means “&lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13183/about-schengen-90-180-rule&quot;&gt;90 days over any 180-day period&lt;/a&gt;”. Consequently, it would be perfectly fine to stay for a couple of months in May-June, leave and come back in September for some time. If there are at least 90 days between both stays, you could even stay three months each time (say mid-April to mid-June and mid-September to mid-November).

Of course, that's only possible if the visa is valid over the whole period. If you apply for a visa for the Italy conference and its validity does not extend to September, you will need to apply for another visa. But do not use all your 90 days during the summer, as the maximum stay rule applies across visas. If you stayed in the Schengen area in May-June-July, you would not be able to re-enter in September.

The only thing you cannot do is stay without interruption between May and September. To do that you would need another purpose (two brief conferences do not justify a 5-month stay) and another type of visa.
The requirement to present anything about travel arrangement derives from article 14(1)(c) of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009R0810&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;regulation&lt;/a&gt;. What it says is (my emphasis):


  &lt;ol&gt;
  When applying for a uniform visa, the applicant shall present:
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  (a) documents indicating the purpose of the journey;
  
  (b) documents in relation to accommodation, or proof of sufficient means to cover his accommodation;
  
  (c) documents indicating that the applicant possesses sufficient &lt;strong&gt;means of subsistence&lt;/strong&gt; both for the duration of the intended stay and &lt;strong&gt;for the return to his country of origin or residence&lt;/strong&gt;, or for the transit to a third country into which he is certain to be admitted, or that he is in a position to acquire such means lawfully, in accordance with Article 5(1)(c) and (3) of the Schengen Borders Code;
  
  (d) information enabling an assessment of the applicant’s intention to leave the territory of the Member States before the expiry of the visa applied for.


Item 35 on the form reads:


  &lt;ol start=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
  Who is &lt;strong&gt;paying for your cost&lt;/strong&gt; of travelling and for your costs of living during your stay? Myself Host person/s Host company. (State who and how and present corresponding
  documentation)
  &lt;/ol&gt;


The fact that “travelling” and “living during your stay“ are mentioned in the same sentence further confirms that this item refers to the requirement laid out in article 14(1)(c) and that what's required is not an actual ticket but only having enough money to buy one.

The only place in the regulation where “reservation of or return or round ticket“ are mentioned is Annex II but it is a “non-exhaustive” list starting with the following sentence “The supporting documents referred to in Article 14, to be submitted by visa applicants &lt;strong&gt;may include&lt;/strong&gt; the following:”.

It's true some unofficial documentation implies that you should present a ticket and not having one would be somewhat unusual and might invite scrutiny but it's not &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; as such, only having the means to travel is. Owning a private plane would seem to fulfil that requirement.

Incidentally, in another context (namely seafarer's visas issued at the border, in annex IX), a car registration number is also mentioned as valid information on the “means of transportation”. Obviously, most visitors are not expected to travel by private plane but when travelling by car, proof of ownership would therefore seem to be enough.
I have a valid US visa in my (expired) old passport. In my new passport the given name and surname have been swapped. Will I have issues traveling back to the US with this new passport, or I should I attempt to get a new visa?
My husband won an academic contest and the prize was a trip to &lt;strong&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt; for a global conference on his specialty. 

He's responsible for paying for food and transportation, but the lodging and flights are being booked through the college.

His options for spending money are:


get cash here in the states (international exchange rate (commercial bank) + 8%)
use his American credit card (Visa) (international exchange rates (credit union) + 1%)
use an ATM while he's there (haven't found fee information yet)


How can we decide how much cash  he should carry? &lt;strong&gt;What types of things is he likely to need cash for?&lt;/strong&gt;

As a note since some answers are concerned with &lt;strong&gt;magnetic stripe versus chip and pin&lt;/strong&gt;: Our credit union is in the process of switching to chip and pin. He was able to call and get a new version of his card so it should be here before he leaves.
'How much to carry' is very personal and individual. Some will buy lots of souvenirs, others will want to splash out on restaurants. Then there's cabs and the like as well.

Consider looking into just withdrawing on your ATM card in Europe. Almost all countries there will support it, and depending on your bank fees, it may be a reasonably economical way of doing it.

You could also take travellers cheques. It's a bit old-fashioned, but they're guaranteed, and safer than having  wads of cash on you.  Of course they can be harder to exchange, and you may find some hotels being grumpy about doing it for you.

We actually have a question &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/10/when-traveling-to-a-country-with-a-different-currency-how-should-you-take-your?rq=1&quot;&gt;on taking currency to a different country&lt;/a&gt; and it has a bunch of suggestions that may help as well. It also discourages the 'cash passports' that some foreign exchange places have offered, as their conversion rate is ... high, to say the least.

The best is to work out roughly what you plan on spending on food, and transportation, and then add some for souvenirs and other incidentals that might occur.
First, it would help if you told us where you permanently reside. Indeed, if you are from the Quebec province, there is an agreement between the RAMQ (medical insurance in Quebec) and the French S�curit� Sociale.

If you are from somewhere else, you might still find some insurances covering for more than a year. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://buy.travelinsurance.ca/Content.aspx?k=aboutInsurance&quot;&gt;Bon Voyage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.desjardins.com/particuliers/assurances/assurance-voyage/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Desjardins&lt;/a&gt; (but they say you should call them for such a long duration). These are for Canada (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pvtistes.net/france/dossiers/les-demarches-administratives-pour-la-demande-du-pvt-france/6/&quot;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;), there are probably some for your permanent residence country.

In general, I let you check &lt;a href=&quot;http://pvtistes.net/france/le-pvt/&quot;&gt;this page from PVTistes.net&lt;/a&gt;, which contains information about the WHV for France (in French, but I guess you can read French). They have explained the different procedures depending on where you reside. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://pvtistes.net/forum/obtenir-son-pvt-france/23990-pvt-france-quelle-assurance-choisir.html&quot;&gt;this forum&lt;/a&gt; covers specifically insurances (apparently the people there are mostly Canadians, though).
I am Indian and have a work visa from Poland. My family was issued Schengen visas. The company I was joining had only booked one way tickets. My new company was planning to request a residence card for my family in Poland. So the Schengen visa for my family was only needed in order for them to enter Poland. After I am issued a residence card, they will be allowed to live with me even after their Schengen visa expires. 

At the time of departure from India, Austrain airlines people asked for return tickets for my family. Because they didn't have any, the airline was not going to allow my family to fly. I had to book return tickets for my family in few minutes and due to the time constraint, I booked non-refundable tickets. We do not have any plan to return to India. Finally, my company is not willing to reimburse the return ticket cost.

Was it legal for Austrain airlines to not allow us to fly?&lt;br&gt;
Will it be possible for me to get a refund the return tickets?
As i understand, at the time of departure, you only had the Schengen visa, but not yet the residence card? The tourist Schengen visa requires a return ticket for a valid entry, so in that case the airline was totally right, since they would be responsible for flying you back, if you would have been denied entry to the Schengen area because of the missing return ticket.
If you are in the area of Sichuan, there is small town east of Chengdu that has a great tea place right on the lake. It's about 8 to 10 rmb and you can drink all day. It's out in the open too so you don't need to worry about scams. 
In Shanghai, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g308272-d2312338-Reviews-Tianshan_Tea_City-Shanghai.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tianshan Tea City&lt;/a&gt;.  This is not far from the Zhongshan Park metro station.  Also, the Cloud 9 shopping mall, which is directly accessible from that station, has a Carrefour where you can get decent tea at cheap prices.

The local teas in that region are green teas, however – Long Jing, Bi Luo Chun and others.  There is some oolong, especially Tie Guanyin (Iron Goddess).  If you’re looking for pu’er cha, why not go to Yunnan?  The markets in Dali and Lijiang are full of shops selling the stuff, and you could certainly get it in Kunming as well.  Below is a video of a Lijiang teashop that many tour groups visit:

In a couple of months I will be traveling to Portugal, and I need to rent a car. Since I have a MasterCard Platinum, I can get coverage and save some money by declining CDW and LDW.

From MasterCard's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mastercard.com/sam/wce/PDF/Credit_Platinum_GTB_English_17_Mar_13_Final.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Guide to Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:


  &lt;strong&gt;To Get Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt;
  
  
  Initiate the transaction under your name and pay for the entire Rental Company’s security deposit using your card and sign the Rental
  Agreement;
  Authorized Drivers whose name(s) appear as a driver on the Rental Agreement will also be covered;
  Pay for the entire rental transaction (tax, gasoline, and airport fees are not considered rental charges) with your card and/or points
  earned by a Rewards Program associated with your card prior to picking
  up or immediately upon the return of the Rental Car; and
  &lt;strong&gt;You must Decline any/all partial or full collision damage insurance or similar collision damage and loss damage waiver (CDW/LDW)
  offered by the Rental Company.&lt;/strong&gt;
  


So I went to search the companies I could book a car from, and, so far, Europcar is the cheapest one I found. However I couldn't find a way to decline those insurance fees.

For instance, these are the options on Europcar:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://cl.ly/image/1W3x1C0B2H1L/Image%202015-04-03%20at%201.04.57%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Europcar&quot;&gt;

As you can see, the first &quot;tier&quot;, &lt;em&gt;Basic&lt;/em&gt; (that looks pretty much CDW+LDW, although not named that way), is already included and cannot be declined.
I would like to know if I there is way I can decline while booking online, or whether it would be better if I rent the car in the airport/company's counter instead of pre-booking it online.
If I travel to a destination in Europe that is outside the UK (my home base), I take 100 Euro in cash.  There's no need for more because ATM's are available.

If I go outside the EEA, like to the US or Africa, I take 200 in Sterling and the equivalent of 100 dollars in local currency (like Canadian dollars for example).  My rationale is that if more cash is needed, then something extraordinary has come up where there's a problem anyway.

The exception being Russia.  Although you are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be purely Rubble in everything you do, you only need about 3,000 Rubble with the rest in Euro.

What Mark didn't mention in his answer (+1 from me by the way) is for the &lt;strong&gt;generic case&lt;/strong&gt; where you &lt;em&gt;travel a lot&lt;/em&gt;.  Then it can be better to keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Which-bank-in-the-US-offers-accounts-denominated-in-euros&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;denominated bank accounts&lt;/a&gt;.  They can help prevent your &lt;a href=&quot;http://au.ibtimes.com/foreign-exchange-fx-terminologies-whipsaw-wholesale-money-working-day-world-bank-writer-1278488&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;getting whipsawed&lt;/a&gt; in both directions. I keep a Dollar account along with my Sterling account just for that purpose.  Talk to your bank if you think that a denominated account can be helpful for you.  These types of accounts are available at most of the major banks in the US.

&lt;strong&gt;Adding from commentary&lt;/strong&gt; 


  If you are going to be driving and the country levies on-the-spot
  speeding (or whatever) penalties, make the cash amount in local
  currency enough so that you will be able to pay there &amp;amp; then. Or
  expect to have your car impounded until you pay in some countries.


&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Update (5 April 2015)&lt;/h1&gt;

You have updated your question to now ask &quot;&lt;strong&gt;What types of things is he likely to need cash for?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;

In the Netherlands (and most of the EEA in general), he would likely need cash for...


News agents
Small grocery stores
Traffic penalties
Tips
Older style taxis and gypsy cabs
Open air market vendors
Charity donations (including cathedral collections)
Illicit items (out of scope here)


The most consequential of these are penalties which are actively intervened by the police (as opposed to violations caught on traffic cameras).  Penalties can vary, but in all except the most egregious cases are less than 50 to 70 Euro...


  Foreign offenders will be fined the penalty payable in the country of
  the offence, but fines vary across Europe, with Germany levying €10
  for a minor speed offence while France fines offenders €68 (or €45 if
  paid promptly).

In the &lt;strong&gt;Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt;, speeding penalties are calculated with a mathematics formula, but it would be extraordinary to see a penalty exceeding 35 Euro if you are clocked within 6 km/h of the limit.

Violations that are caught on camera are dealt with by a penalty notice sent to the registered owner.  For visitors it means the rental agency will pay the fine and debit your credit card for the amount plus their handling fee.
I am planning a trip to northern Italy. I will start it with two days of Giro d'Italia in and around Genoa and then I will move on to Verona for a javascript conference. I was thinking that flying to Milan (from Sweden) would be the best option and then get around by train. However I just now realized that although Genoa is an hour or so from Milan by train - Verona is more like 4 hours and a stop in Bologna. 

Are there any obvious better way to do this than flying to Milan?

UPDATE: I had it wrong about train from Verona to Milan - it is also 1-2 hours. Still it is a bit cumbersome to travel like this.
I think you are mistaken on your journey times, but Milan is still definitely your best bet.

By train, Milan to Genoa is over 4 hours, and Genoa to Verona is over 6 hours.

By road, however, the times are more like 1:30 from Milan to Genoa and 3 hours Genoa to Verona

Why not hire a car for the trip? Driving in northern Italy can be an amazing experience.
Our relatives are residents of the US. We invited them to visit us in this summer.

Unfortunately they live quite far from Dutch embassies but fortunately there is an Italian embassy in their state. I know two countries are not related but would it be possible to get visas in Italian embassy. Just to save time and money for them.
This is sometimes possible but only if the two countries have an agreement to do it and, as far as I know, that's not the case for the Netherlands and Italy in the US. 

Such agreements are getting more common but very often it's between neighbouring countries (e.g. the Benelux, Nordic countries) and in places where the destination country does not have any representation. You cannot generally apply to any consulate from any Schengen country.

In this particular case, the Netherlands does have an embassy in Washington and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.government.nl/issues/visa-for-the-netherlands-and-the-caribbean-parts-of-the-kingdom/documents-and-publications/publications/2014/02/20/embassies-responsible-for-short-stay-visa-for-the-netherlands.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it seems it's not possible to apply elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. You could still inquire at the embassy to see if some other arrangement is possible but it does not look like it.
If you overstayed, noone will stop you on the way out, they will be quite happy to see you go. You'll have a problem the next time you try to enter. The embassy issued travel document will be fine, that's what it's for.
I will be taking the Keikyu Airport Line from Haneda to Onarimon Station. 

According to Google transit it shows the following:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rWwKm.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

My question is this, where it has Keikyu Airport Line towards Inzaimakinohara, and then Keikyu Main Line towards Inzaimakinohara (squared off in green), do I need to change trains? Or, is this actually the same train, and it's just broken up on the transit directions?

Not sure if it will help, but here is the link to the Google maps with the transit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Haneda+Airport+International+Terminal+Station,+Tokyo,+Japan/Onarimon+Station,+Tokyo,+Japan/@35.6137519,139.7461115,12z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m19!4m18!1m5!1m1!1s0x60186156b2f277b1:0xc59dac631427bf6c!2m2!1d139.767021!2d35.54506!1m5!1m1!1s0x60188bbfe5f5e897:0x626dfab60e48e775!2m2!1d139.751535!2d35.661215!2m4!4e3!6e4!7e2!8j1429205400!3e3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt;

Having an actual ticket is certainly not required to enter the Schengen area, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/45553/schengen-air-travel-confirmation-and-private-aircraft/45567#45567&quot;&gt;Schengen air travel confirmation and private aircraft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/26348/getting-a-schengen-visa-without-firm-travel-plans&quot;&gt;Getting a Schengen visa without firm travel plans&lt;/a&gt; for all the details.

That said, it's also true that the airline who brought a passenger to a country can be forced to bring the person back to their point of departure or be fined for transporting them without checking their visa and they sometimes err on the side of caution (for them…).

Whether it is legal to refuse to carry you is down to contract law and consumer protection rules. In Austrian's case, the only relevant rule I could find is article 7 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.austrian.com/Info/LegalRegulations/ConditionsOfCarriage.aspx?cc=AT&amp;amp;sc_lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their General Conditions of Carriage&lt;/a&gt;


  In the reasonable exercise of our discretion, we may refuse to carry you or your Baggage on our flights, provided that we have previously notified you in writing. Under these circumstances you will of course be entitled to a refund.

The language is a bit broad and I doubt you would have much luck seeking redress but I don't really know.
According to Wikipedia, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiky%C5%AB_Airport_Line&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Keikyū Airport Line&lt;/a&gt; is the 6.5km stretch from Haneda to Keikyū Kamada, at which the line changes name and becomes &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiky%C5%AB_Main_Line&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Keikyū Main Line&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haneda-tokyo-access.com/en/transport/trainlinemap.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Airport Line offers Airport Express service&lt;/a&gt; from Haneda to your destination, you shouldn't have to change train at Kamada. Moreover this is reflected in the screenshot you posted which all in all seems to suggest only a line name change rather than an actual connection.
If the name on my boarding pass lists Debbie and my Drivers License lists Debra, will this be a problem?
According to the TSA's web site:


  &lt;strong&gt;If the name printed on my boarding pass is different than what appears on my government ID, will I be turned away at security and
  unable to fly?&lt;/strong&gt; 
  
  Boarding passes may not always display the exact name you provided
  when booking your travel. The name you provide is used to perform
  watch list matching before a boarding pass is issued, so small
  differences should not impact your travel.


Reference: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tsa.gov/content/frequently-asked-questions-secure-flight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
What if my first name doesn't exactly match my ID?
I think you are overreacting to the credit card charges.  A 1% transaction fee is small, most credit cards charge 3%.  Also, most credit cards give a very fair currency exchange rate.  Even if you spend $1000 on the credit card during your trip, that only amounts to an additional $10.  Enjoy the trip, take only a small amount of cash, and use the credit card as much as possible. If your card has a cashback feature, then it should cost you almost nothing to use it. 
I travel a lot and I'm looking at getting a United Club membership. What I'm wondering is -- is there any advantage at all to buying a membership rather than getting the credit card?

A membership is $500 for one person, or $750 for one person and a spouse. The club card costs $395, comes with a United Club membership which automatically allows traveling companions to join you, and has other perks like free checked bags.

The card seems to be a better deal in every day, so why does the normal membership exist? Is it just there for people with bad credit or something?
According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1132/~/citizen-of-visa-waiver-country,-wants-to-drive-into-u.s.-from-canada-or-mexico&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1132/~/citizen-of-visa-waiver-country,-wants-to-drive-into-u.s.-from-canada-or-mexico&lt;/a&gt;,


  If you are a citizen of a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), and you enter the U.S. by land from Mexico or Canada, you are only required to complete the paper I-94W form at the land border crossing.  ESTA is currently required for air and cruise ship travel only.
  
  Note:  VWP citizens do not need an ESTA to travel on the ferries between Vancouver and Victoria, BC and Washington state.  &lt;strong&gt;They are treated as a land border port.&lt;/strong&gt;

Firstly note that United Club membership also allows up to 2 guests - same as the United Club Card.  The higher 'plus Spouse' rate means that you both get a card, and thus can both enter when travelling separately.  The price you've stated is also only correct for someone without any status in United's Mileage Plus program - the higher your status, the lower the price. (eg, as a 1K, my UC membership only costs $400/year)

In general, the only different between the two methods of access is that the United Club Card is a credit card, and thus requires you to apply for it, and sustain the impact that such an application will have on your credit score. Obviously if your credit score isn't high enough it's also possible that you'll be rejected.

United Club membership on the other hand is just a simple payment. No impact on credit score, no chance of being rejected, etc.
If you are interested in both United Club membership and holding a United mileage credit card, by all means go for the United Club card. But everyone isn't necessarily like you.


Some people aren't interested in holding an additional credit card, or can't qualify for an additional credit card, or can't qualify for this particular card, but are still interested in United Club membership.
Some people don't want another card, but also don't mind the higher membership fee because they pay for Club membership with miles.
Some people don't want another card, but also don't mind the higher membership fee because they are reimbursed for membership through their employer or other organization.
Some people don't want another card, but also don't mind the membership fee because it is discounted on account of their frequent flyer status.
United frequent flyer elites already receive the non-Club benefits of the card such as a free checked baggage allowance and priority boarding, so Premiers and GS gain nothing from the card in terms of travel privileges except for Club membership.


All the U.S. carriers are heavily dependent on their affiliated credit cards for revenue, so it is unsurprising that United finds the idea of gaining another cardholder more desirable than a mere hundred dollars of annual revenue. The time may come when that is no longer the case, and the annual card fee and the annual club membership fee may fall closer together in price, but the option to join the club without holding the credit card is not likely to go away.

(Note that the United Club membership provided through the card is a regular United Club membership. There is no special tier of membership just for credit card holders; you are not entitled to any benefits beyond an ordinary Club membership. You are entitled to same number of guests as well: 2 adults, or 1 adult with any dependent children, not an unlimited number of traveling companions.)
Obviously I know the answer is yes, but if I visited a European country and stole something there would I actually be put in jail and face trial or be deported or face trial in the US? 
It would depend on the crime and sentence, but basically:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://london.usembassy.gov/cons_new/acs/scs/arrest_of_an_american.html&quot;&gt;The US cannot get a citizen out of another country's prison&lt;/a&gt; is one example of an embassy stating this, and indeed, especially if they are allies, countries tend not to get engaged in the laws and cases in other countries.

Of course, you can ask your embassy /consulate for a visit and they can do everything to help you in the process.

Sometimes,  when the laws differ greatly from your home, your country &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; offer a trade, embargoes or condemnation - for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/government-to-lead-angry-reaction-with-official-visits-already-suspended/story-e6frflo9-1227247772411&quot;&gt;Australia has been quite vocal recently over the impending execution of Australian citizens in Bali&lt;/a&gt;.  In this case, an offer was even made for the sentenced to do the remainder of their term in an Australian prison, so that's an option sometimes (very rarely though).

You could certainly face trial in the country of the incident though, not your home country, depending on agreements between the two.
My mother in law forgot her original PAN Card. She has a photocopy of the same. Can she fly in domestic airline with this Photocopy of PAN Card? She has her flight tomorrow i.e. on 5 April from Ahmedabad to Pune. She is from Jalgaon.
Absolutely not. No airline will accept a photocopy of an ID since it'd be trivial to counterfeit one. And these days just about every airline wants to know who flies with them for two reasons: a) avoid people with some evil intent b) allow identifying victims of a crash.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airindia.in/documents-to-carry.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Air India&lt;/a&gt; on the topic:


  For domestic travel within India, valid photo identification, namely, a passport, Income Tax PAN Card, Voter’s ID or Driving license is mandatory.


A copy is not valid.
@CSJC I built a tool to help you find exactly what you're looking for here: www.cleverlayover.com

It will search all A-&gt;B + B-&gt;C combinations to find a cheaper way to get from A-&gt;C. Looking into the data, it is actually quite effective: 33% of searches have some form of savings, and the savings average &gt; $300 when they exist. Try it out and let me know what you think!
My partner and I are about to travel around Europe and the UK. My partner is travelling with two passports, Australian and British. 
I will be only travelling on an Australian passport.

I have also obtained a Tier 5 youth mobility visa for the UK. I am aware that this will not allow me free travel periods throughout the EU but I wondered  as I am travelling with my defacto if I would still be required to stick to Schengen guides of 90 days in the EU in a 180 day period? 
It's probably not the broker who changed the flight but the airline, which indeed has the right to cancel and/or reschedule flights. However &lt;strong&gt;it would seem that, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airtickets24.com/misc/faq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the FAQ page from AirTicket24&lt;/a&gt;, you can ask for compensation in case of substantial changes&lt;/strong&gt;:


  &lt;h3&gt;23. What happens if the airline changes its flights?&lt;/h3&gt;
  
  The airlines are sometimes forced to modify the itineraries, hours and number of their flights. In this case we will try to inform you for any changes before the date of departure so that you adjust your program to these changes. These changes are usually of minor importance without significant impact on your trip. If significant changes occur related to your flight (for example change in departure time for more than 2 hours or change of departure airport) and you have no alternative that suits you then you can request compensation from the airline, according to the passenger's rights established by the European Union, unless you have been informed on time by the airline.


Hence I would go ahead and contact both your broker, quoting the FAQ, add well as your airline to see what can be arranged. 
On an upcoming trip, I'll be flying from Dublin to the USA, on a flight which has US pre-clearance in Dublin.

I'm reasonably happy (based on experiences) about how far in advance I need to get to Dublin airport for a normal international departure, to cover checkin + security + walking + etc. However, I've not taken a pre-clearance flight before.

When factoring in when to get to Dublin airport, for a pre-clearance flight where I'll need to go through US customs and immigration in Dublin, how much extra time do I need to allow for the US pre-clearance formalities?
I think you are. In fact, it would still be the case if you were married. The Schengen regulations contain many provisions regarding members of the family of EU citizens (relaxed requirements to obtain a visa, whether their passport need to be stamped, etc.) but no clear exemption from the maximum stay rule.

What your relationship allows (with some caveat for de facto relationships and without conditions for married couples) is taking up residence in any EU and/or Schengen country. But as long as you don't secure a residence card, the 90-day rule applies.

On a purely theoretical level, you could try to argue that this curtails your partner's right of free movement but it seems that in practice the current state of the law does restrict the length of your stays in the Schengen area.

Importantly, article 10 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02006R0562-20131126&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Schengen Borders Code&lt;/a&gt; provides that:


  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  The travel documents of nationals of third countries who are members of the family of a Union citizen to whom Directive 2004/38/EC applies, but who do not present the residence card provided for in that Directive, shall be stamped on entry and exit.
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  […]
  
  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
  No entry or exit stamp shall be affixed:
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  
  […]
  
  (g) to the travel documents of nationals of third countries who present a residence card provided for in Directive 2004/38/EC.


Stamping only makes sense to check if a person abided by the maximum stay rule and the regulation clearly makes a distinction between third-country nationals who enjoy the right of free movement (“to whom Directive 2004/38/EC applies“) but do not have an actual residence card and those who do.

Similarly, holders of long-stay visas or residence permits in a Schengen country (including members of the family of an EU citizen or youth-mobility/work-holiday visa holders) are only entitled to travel to other Schengen countries for 90 days in any 180-day period. In practice, enforcement is difficult and limited but the logic of the system is clear: You can only take up residence in one country and visit others for a short time, not travel indefinitely in the whole area without any formality.

Another subtlety is that directive 2004/38/EC specifies in many places that failure to comply with one obligation or another should only result in “proportionate and non-discriminatory sanctions“. What is implied here is that overstaying could make you liable for a fine but should not result in detention, deportation or a ban. So there are some rules and restrictions on stays longer than three months but you are in principle protected from some of the most serious consequences of breaking them.
I'm hoping to get some insight as to what the outcome of my B2 cohabitating visa application may be. 

When I was a child my parents overstayed on a B1/B2 visa from (2001-2009) - as far as I'm aware we did return to our home country for a period of time.

In 2009 at the age of 16 I returned to my home country in the UK.

Since our overstay I have travelled to the US on an ESTA Visa on 2 separate occasions, no questions asked.

That being said, I am now applying for a B2 co-habitating visa to accompany my partner on a move to Baltimore for work. 

Will the embassy question the overstay? If so, will they be willing to overlook as I was a child? Unfortunately my father has passed away so it is a very grey area why we had overstayed in the first place.
Is it possible to order from an online store that ships via UPS so that I can pick it up while on vacation in the US? As I will be couch surfing I would like to send it to a &quot;neutral&quot; pick up station. 

What would be the best approach to do this? Can I enter a pick up station as the recipient address of my order?  
I haven't been to the NL that often yet, but credit cards should work in most places and even if not, debit cards do almost everywhere. However, I strongly suggest to always have around 50 to 100€ per person in cash on you; after all, you never know... Here in Switzerland the EFT system broke down for some hours recently. In such a case it's always good to have cash on you.

&lt;em&gt;// Old version; for reference if anybody cares :D&lt;/em&gt;

I would like to add that it depends a lot on WHERE in Europe you travel.

Though credit cards are widely spread here too it's by far not as far-spread as in the US. Even our big retailers here in Switzerland do not accept credit cards in many (if not most) of their stores. The same also applies to small hotels and a large number of restaurants.

However, the situation is again completely different if you go to Sweden. There they use credit cards in a fashion comparable to the US and you can use them almost everywhere (though cash is accepted as well).

It really largely depends on where you travel. So if you could clarify that, we could help more accurately.

" Body="When I needed something mailed in the US while travelling, I organised ahead with a hostel in Los Angeles.  We were going to stay there anyway, and you might find they want you to book a night if you're going to collect mail from them, but give a hostel a call and see if they'll accept mail on your behalf - I've done it in several countries now with no problems.

(Wait, one problem, a package in Moscow never showed up. But generally it's worked fine).
These are popular in Germany and are available in the retail markets there.  I used the Google search term &quot;Rei�verschluss Reise Bettw�sche&quot; which roughly translates to 'bed sheets for travel that close with a zipper'.  I also used &quot;Hausstaubmilben-Allergiker&quot; (house dust allergy) with less conclusive results.

From a &lt;em&gt;canonical&lt;/em&gt; point of view, the objective in using these sheets is to insulate yourself from the sheets and covers provided by the hotel (or host) such that your contact is limited to your own bedding and to thereby enjoy a more hygienic sleep.  They would be indispensable for tropical or dusty venues and a solid travel tip for almost anywhere else. The image below demonstrates how they work... 

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/7jmfl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

The red line portrays a cross-sectional view of how the sheet is meant to be used.  There is a zipper on the side so that all contact with the bed and bedding is avoided.

I looked at the various offerings in the market and selected a vendor that offered the closest product to what you are looking for.  I then sent them an email in German asking if they were able to handle an English speaking customer and provide this product by telephone or on-line ordering.

They answered my email promptly and confirmed they are happy to receive your English enquiries (by telephone or by email) and ship to you.  The large sheet is 39 Euro plus shipping if you are outside of Germany.  I forgot to ask if they will  give VAT relief for non-EEA customers so it's something you can take up when you enquire.

Note for your specific requirements:  this product is machine washable and tumble dried.

Their email is  info@allergika.de and their site is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allergika.de/Produkte/Hausstaubmilben%20Allergie/ALLERGIKA%20Travel%20Reiseschlafsack.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.allergika.de/Produkte/Hausstaubmilben%20Allergie/ALLERGIKA%20Travel%20Reiseschlafsack.html&lt;/a&gt;

To be fair, there is another vendor at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bettwaren-shop.de/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.bettwaren-shop.de/&lt;/a&gt; offering virtually the same product at a comparable price.

While your overstay does cancel your visa at the time unlike an adult you are not banned for 3/10 years because of this. That's why you also got an ESTA. You will have no problems from the overstay.

You can check the relevant &lt;a href=&quot;http://caracas.usembassy.gov/visas/section-212a9b-of-the-immigration-and-nationality-act.html&quot;&gt;Section 212(a)(9)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act&lt;/a&gt; as well, it says the same.
Your question is how to find one, and not to make a direct referral of a translator/guide.  I have &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; that you want a trustworthy and reasonably high quality daily escort.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/101/mark-mayo&quot;&gt;Mark Mayo&lt;/a&gt; added 'credible and/or official sources to the question.  To research an answer I sent out five emails (I made it clear that I intended to pay the fair market rate for that service)...


The Chinese Commercial Attach� at the Chinese Embassy in New York
The Chinese Commercial Attach� at the Chinese Embassy in London
The Catholic Diocese in Beijing
The Church of England post at the Theological Seminary in Nanjing
The British Council's mission in China


The two commercial attaches replied within several hours.  They both said that they could not help.

The British Council replied saying that they do not make referrals on an official basis and suggested that the Cultural Section at the British Embassy in Beijing may be able to help.  I then contacted the consular officer on a personal basis and he was able to help make several referrals &lt;em&gt;subject to my schedule and the specific regions&lt;/em&gt; of China I would be visiting.  I would consider these to be the most trustworthy and highest quality translators/guides.  

The two religious organisations both replied wanting &lt;em&gt;further details of my schedule and geographic destinations within China&lt;/em&gt;.  Also the &lt;em&gt;type of translation required&lt;/em&gt; (simultaneous, consecutive, whispered, or escort) and if &lt;em&gt;engineering or technical expertise&lt;/em&gt; was needed.  Although I was vague, they invited me to contact them again when my plans were solidified.  Based upon the email exchanges I am confident that I would be ultimately referred to a trustworthy and high quality translator/guide.

I also searched the net for language schools and escorted tours, but these are readily available to you anyway and would be difficult to qualify them as '&lt;em&gt;credible and/or official sources&lt;/em&gt;'.  See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=escorted+tours+in+china&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=escorted+tours+in+china&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

For your question, how to find one, you can use this template...

&lt;ol&gt;
Nail down your travel dates along with the specific locations you will be visiting.  This seems to be vital in order to proceed.
Identify which type of translation you need: simultaneous, consecutive, whispered, escort
Identify any niche vocabulary requirements such as engineering or technical terms
Compose an introductory email that lists all of the above and send it to the cultural section of the embassy in China that represents your nationality. You may need to approach an officer on a personal basis.
Do the same for any allied cultural organisation in China that has a post designated for your nationality or religion.  If you need an introduction you may be able to obtain one locally from the corresponding organisation in your own country.
Follow up as needed.  Including another, more detailed question on this site if needed.
&lt;/ol&gt;
Plenty of countries have agreements where you can serve your sentence in your home country &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you have been convicted in the country you were prosecuted in.

Being put on trial in another country from where the crime was allegedly committed is extremely uncommon (and also would generally no make much sense), but theoretically possible. 

That said, specifically the US has made certain actions a US crime when committed abroad. This won't apply to theft (unless you perhaps plan on stealing the Mona Lisa, though then the US might extradite you to France if you get caught in the US, while France would obviously prosecute), but typically applies to moral and sexual crimes which might not be clearly regulated in the country the crime was committed. Here's a blog that talks about a US Marine who molested girls in Cambodia and was convicted in the US:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2014/06/how-to-prosecute-crimes-committed-abroad.html&quot;&gt;http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2014/06/how-to-prosecute-crimes-committed-abroad.html&lt;/a&gt;
Depending on the countries involved, both are possible and there are a few other scenarios too.


You are arrested, prosecuted locally and serve your sentence where you committed your crime. As others have said, local law fully applies, it happens all the time. Your home country should be informed and can at most complain and try to exert some pressure on a political level but you don't have any extraordinary legal protection only because you are a foreign national. For a famous recent case illustrating this, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Knox&quot;&gt;Amanda Knox&lt;/a&gt;.
You are arrested, prosecuted and sentenced but you are allowed to serve your sentence in your home country. As @MastaBaba pointed out, there are international agreements to organise this on a bilateral basis.
You are arrested, prosecuted, sentenced and you serve your sentence but it doesn't end there. You can still be deported and/or banned &lt;em&gt;after the end of your sentence&lt;/em&gt;. Many European countries have actually introduced or strengthened legislation to this end in the last decade. So it's not either face trial or be deported, if you are really “lucky” it could be both!
You are arrested and criminal proceedings are initiated but you manage to come back home at some point during the procedure. In Europe, for a simple theft with no prior offence or aggravating circumstances, a jail sentence is unlikely and it is therefore unusual to be detained prior to trial. If you choose to “jump bail” and somehow manage to leave the country, things become a bit complicated. Among the possibilities:


The country where you committed your crime seeks your extradition to force you to appear in court and/or execute your sentence (not always possible because some countries never extradite their own citizens). For another prominent example, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski&quot;&gt;Roman Polanski&lt;/a&gt;.
You are sentenced &lt;em&gt;in absentia&lt;/em&gt;. Institutions like the Council of Europe have been pushing against this practice but some countries still do it. You might or might not be entitled to a retrial when you are finally caught but one effect is typically to suspend or extend statutes of limitation so that such a sentence means you will have to look over your shoulder and avoid going back to the country of your crime (or possibly all the countries that have an extradition treaty with that country) for the rest of your life.
You could still face prosecution in your home country (see below), although that would seem exceedingly unlikely for a theft.

Nothing happens, you come back home and are prosecuted in your country of origin. Many countries do that for particularly serious crimes but some countries also allow it for pretty much everything, in particular because they never extradite their own citizens. In the latter case, the crime in question must typically exist in the laws of both countries whereas in the former case, it's sometimes even possible to prosecute people for things that were not illegal where and when they happened (e.g. in many European countries, laws against child prostitution typically apply to offences committed abroad, without any reference to local law).
You are prosecuted in another, unrelated third country. It's unusual and typically limited to particularly heinous crimes (and in particular war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide) but it does happen. Among those that might take interest are your country or countries of residence or the country of origin or residence of any of your victims and Baltasar Garzón. See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_jurisdiction&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.


Among other curiosities, the fact that it might sometimes be possible to be prosecuted in several places also raises questions related to the application of the &lt;em&gt;non bis in idem&lt;/em&gt; principle.

In short, it depends a lot on the details, there is no overarching principle or international agreement that would apply in all cases. 
I'm from the UK, but I live in Thailand.  

I grew up in Spain and was a resident there, but for the last 9 years I've lived in Thailand. I would like to take my Thai wife and our daughter to Spain to see all my family that live there.  

We have made one attempt for a family visit visa, using my grandfather as the sponsor. At that time, my wife and I were not married; we had only our daughter to prove our relationship. We got married while that first visa application was in process.

Four days later the application was denied. We appealed it and added in the marriage registration (written in Thai). We also included a doctor's letter from Spain, explaining that my grandmother has recently had several strokes and was partially paralyzed, in order to show urgency. I don't believe we will win the appeal.  

Now that we are married, if the appeal is denied, should I apply for the follow your husband visa?  If I do, what is needed for that type?  

I hope someone can give us some advice, as we are really running out of time. As I said, my grandmother's health is very bad. She is 91 and my grandfather is 97. They really want to meet my wife and see their new great-granddaughter.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aerlingus.com/travelinformation/movetoterminal2atdublin/usimmigration/&quot;&gt;Aer Lingus suggests to head for pre-clearance no later than 90 minutes before the flight.&lt;/a&gt; This could be a good initial indicator to be adjusted depending on experience. Quoting from their website:


  After check-in, passengers on these flights should follow airport signage for the US pre-clearance facility. The entrance to the US pre-clearance facility is adjacent to gate 408. Please proceed to the facility not later than 90-minutes before Departure.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/21590139-post8.html&quot;&gt;This post on flyertalk&lt;/a&gt; says the OP managed to check-in, get through pre-clearance and board in 35 minutes. Note that the person used Global Access/Entry to achieve this, and also mentions that queues are longer for people who don't use this service. 
He should carry about as much cash as he normally carries at home. And, with the &lt;strong&gt;outrageous&lt;/strong&gt; 8% fee your bank charges for changing money, he should just get that cash from an ATM in the Netherlands (e.g., at the airport), unless you find that your bank charges an even more outrageous fee for using ATMs abroad.
It will depend on where in Spain, as that is regulated by local government (autonom�as). You should ask the local municipality (ayuntamiento) for an authorization, and you will probably be required to pay some form of tax.

I've been trying to find an authoritative source but, as Spanish government is so decentralised, regulation is so fragmented that I couldn't find any. 

&lt;strong&gt;Edit after clarifications&lt;/strong&gt;

I found for the date you specified a quote from a taxi company, between 26 and 31 EUR from Orly Sud to Denfert-Rochereau and 34 to 42 EUR to the Pasteur Metro Station. 

You can also hire a limousine service, a so-called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiture_de_tourisme_avec_chauffeur&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;VTC&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (voiture de tourisme avec chauffeur), you will have between 35 and 40 EUR from Orly to Paris intra muros (whatever the exact address). VTC services are totally legal in France.

The 20 EUR that have been mentioned by the other person apply to the controversial UberPOP service. 
I am an Indian citizen. and i am flying to New York, US on 27th April 2015. my flight is from Lucknow to Mumbai and then my connecting flight is from Mumbai with a layover of 8 hrs. Do the airport authorities allow us to leave the airport for a few hours?
Let's tear this question apart because it's reasonably common. I will answer the generic question, the specific should be clear after:

&lt;ol&gt;
You intend to leave the airport after stepping off a flight. If you have the legal right to stay in the country then this shouldn't be a problem. In most cases, if you are allowed inside the terminal you should be in the clear: you might simply be visa exempt or you have a visa that allows you into the country not just the airport. Citizens of countries needing Schengen airport transit visas, certain citizens who can transfer through a Canadian airport to the USA without a visa etc are exceptions. Also, if you fall under this, don't you worry, you will not be let out of the transit area. If you see a way to exit the transit area without passing a border guard / immigration officer, you are good to go.
You intend to reenter the secure area of the airport. You need a boarding pass (and in some countries, a government issued ID) for this. There are almost no exceptions to this rule.
&lt;/ol&gt;
It's up to you, not the airline, to have a valid visa for any countries you may be visiting.  

You've not clarified which countries the missing visa is for, but a responsibility the airline DOES have is to ensure you have completed the required visa acquisition for any countries that they fly you to.  As a result, if your missing visa is one of these, they're unlikely to want to risk flying you to said countries, even if you promise you'll get the visa at the layover airport (Chicago ORD).

It's generally pretty risky going to any country without a visa/onwards visa - and the US especially don't take kindly to even forgetting to fill out an ESTA for those who don't require visas :/

You COULD call the airline and see if they'll change your flight to give you more time to obtain said visa, but other than that, the airline is out of the equation here - it's between you and the visa company to get it sorted beforehand.

(I realise you've already had this flight and the visa did manage to arrive in time, but I wanted to clarify for future readers.)
I recently did a trip to the Netherlands (for the first time) to a professional conference and I faced the same dilemma. How much cash to carry?

Here is what I found out:

&lt;ol&gt;
I initially thought that I would be hit by a lot of high rate fees on both my debit and credit cards.
Then I thought, what if I am stuck somewhere that doesn't accept my card?
&lt;/ol&gt;

It turns out both my fears were unfounded:

&lt;ol&gt;
First of all &quot;cash&quot; is a loose concept in the Netherlands and depending on where you go about in the city, you may not need it at all. I only used cash when I forgot to add a tip to the bill (I stayed in Amsterdam and traveled frequently on the public transit); and I remember using it to tip the taxi driver when I couldn't figure out how to get to somewhere on the transit (turns out, streets in Amsterdam are confusingly named even for the taxi drivers).  Out of sheer nervousness (and to make sure my card worked) I withdrew cash at the airport lobby to purchase the train ticket. Turns out, this was also unnecessary as the automated machines accept credit cards and so do the agents at the counter.
As your card is billed in USD (a major currency) you will not be hit with the double whammy of having to convert your card's issuing currency into EUR and then EUR into USD and then back - this was not the case with me (unfortunately).
The fees are very reasonable; so much so that &lt;em&gt;it is cheaper to use your card than to carry cash&lt;/em&gt;. The only exception is if you are converting a large amount of EUR (something in the 10,000 range) where you would be getting a favorable mid-market rate).
&lt;/ol&gt;

My recommendation:

&lt;ol&gt;
Make sure you notify your bank of your travel plans so that they don't block your card thinking you are a target of skimming/fraud. This would also help you as you can ask your bank if there are any specific ATMs that would charge less for cash (your bank may have preferred arrangements).
If you feel you must, carry no more than 200 EUR in cash with you. The &lt;em&gt;cheapest way to get this&lt;/em&gt; would be to buy it in the US from a forex bureau. Avoid the ones at the airport (as they have a hidden airport tax).  Your bank may also offer you a nice rate.
You will find it most convenient to use your credit card; I am struggling to recall even seeing an ATM (besides the one at the airport) during my stroll through Amsterdam.
Avoid using your &lt;em&gt;debit card&lt;/em&gt;. The rates aren't as favorable plus almost all ATMs in Europe are CHIP+PIN enabled, your card &lt;em&gt;may be&lt;/em&gt; rejected if it doesn't have a chip (most US issued ATM cards don't). Credit cards are an exception.
The most expensive way to get cash would be to use your credit card at at ATM in the Netherlands.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Since you asked specifically, places you may need to use cash:

&lt;ol&gt;
Restaurants (some may not have POS machines).
Tipping (in general). This is a personal habit of mine as I always forget to add the tip on the card receipt.
Topping up your travel card on the tram (if you don't do it automatically at the machines).
&lt;/ol&gt;

Beyond the above, during my 4 day trip I didn't need to use any cash. In fact, I ended up bringing the majority of it back with me.

Enjoy your trip!
I've had trouble in the past &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/12787/finding-flights-to-cuba-with-a-flight-search-engine&quot;&gt;looking for flights to Cuba&lt;/a&gt; since the US seems to restrict sales of flights there.

I'm likely going to Iran later this year, but while flights seem readily accessible, my usual booking sites for accommodation (booking.com, hostelbookers, hostelworld) all don't even have an option for Iran, and refuse to accept Tehran in their search.

Is there an embargo for this or am I just missing something?  

  We have made one attempt for a family visit visa, using my grandfather
  as the sponsor. At that time, my wife and I were not married; we had
  only our daughter to prove our relationship. We got married while that
  first visa application was in process.


Here is the situation as I see it. As your visa was going through the approval process, your marital status changed.

This may have made your application invalid, which is why it was rejected.

As far as I am aware, as you are a EU citizen, the following would apply to you (and your family):


  All Union citizens have the right to enter another Member State by
  virtue of having an identity card or valid passport. Under no
  circumstances can an entry or exit visa be required. Where the
  citizens concerned do not have travel documents, the host Member State
  must afford them every reasonable means in obtaining the requisite
  documents or having them sent.
  
  &lt;strong&gt;Family members who do not have the nationality of a Member State enjoy
  the same rights as the citizen who they have accompanied.&lt;/strong&gt; They may be
  subject to a short-stay visa requirement under Regulation (EC) No
  539/2001. Residence permits will be deemed equivalent to short-stay
  visas.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33152_en.htm&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;

Therefore, I suggest you immediately apply for a short stay visa for your wife and child to visit Spain. As you are now legally married (please make sure your marriage is registered at the UK mission as well), I do not see an issue here.
This is my first time posting on this forum. I am a resident of U.A.E. and a Pakistani national. I was born in U.A.E.

I am planning to transit through UK to Colombia for visit during June / July 2015 and will spend few days (5 days) in London on my way back from Colombia. I am confused as to what kind of visa for UK would I be needing for this? My scenario is explained below:

15 June 2015: Flight from Abu Dhabi to London

16 June 2015: Transit to Colombia via London

30 July 2015: Return to London from Colombia

05 July 2015: Return back to Abu Dhabi

Two visa choices:

(1) I can obtain Business Visitor Visa (I have traveled to UK on Business Visitor Visa in past). Can this visa be used to transit to another country?

(2) If I obtain Visitor in Transit Visa, I can't stay in London for more than 48 hours.

Would I need BOTH the Business Visitor and Visitor in Transit visas?

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Regards.
You only need one kind of visa, and the one you need will be determined by the purpose of your visit &lt;em&gt;to the UK&lt;/em&gt;.

If your previous Business Visit visa has not yet expired, you can use that to safely transit.

On your outbound journey (UAE to Columbia), you'll need a DATV (airside transit visa) if you are transiting through the same airport and are not going to stay at the airport for more than 24 hours.

If you are changing airports, or your transit window is greater than 24 hours, you'll need a Visitor In Transit visa.

The same applies to you on your return journey.
Generally speaking, US businesses are not allowed to do business with/in Iran (there are some exceptions). In practice this means that American accommodation finders can not (or will not) offer accommodation inside Iran as this would run the risk of them breaking US law and getting fined immensely for it. Yes, with the current nuclear deal being a near-reality, this is likely to change soon.

How messed up this is, is shown with that even many businesses that are not American but do business with businesses in America choose not also do business in Iran, as that can result in them being banned from doing business with the US (or be fined accordingly).

Stay on top of things with information directly from the US treasury:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/iran.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/iran.aspx&lt;/a&gt;

An article on what the nuclear deal could result in, business wise:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/end-of-iran-sanctions-will-open-gates-to-companies-keen-to-enlarge-markets&quot;&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/end-of-iran-sanctions-will-open-gates-to-companies-keen-to-enlarge-markets&lt;/a&gt;

A (year old) article on that the US penalises foreign companies and individuals for doing business with/in Iran:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349653/us-penalizes-companies-over-iran-trade/&quot;&gt;http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349653/us-penalizes-companies-over-iran-trade/&lt;/a&gt;

A recent article of the German Commerzbank being fined heavily, in the US, for obfuscating financial transactions with Iranian entities:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://rt.com/business/240353-commerzbank-billion-fine-sanctions/&quot;&gt;http://rt.com/business/240353-commerzbank-billion-fine-sanctions/&lt;/a&gt;

I managed to put a few $k USD in my PayPal account from a side business over time. Now, the only problem is PayPal does not have the option to send me the money in a cheque to cash it due to my location, as they do not have that option for countries other than the US. The only option I have is sending the money to my credit card. 

In addition to that, my credit card issuer allows me to overpay my credit card, and the excess amount will be treated as if it was on a debit account, that's cool but I can't withdraw that money in cash, because cash rules will still apply if I try to cash that amount from any ATM, meaning I will lose some good % from that money.

So basically I will have a credit card with a few extra $k ready to be spent without taking any credit from the bank. 

Will the US embassy or any EU embassy accept this as a proof of fund since it is as good as cash in my checking account (I can provide the embassy with a credit card monthly report which shows this)? I searched and found nothing related to this. 
Under Delta's SkyMiles program (both the old one and the new one that began in 2015,) Medallion Qualifying Miles (MQMs) are earned per mile flown, but earn a minimum of 500 per leg. Additionally, the MQMs earned for a given leg are multiplied by 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 depending on the fare class. However, I'm not sure if the multiplier is applied before or after applying the 500 mile minimum. Their website seemed ambiguous on this point.

So, my question is: &lt;strong&gt;Is the fare class multiplier or the minimum applied first?&lt;/strong&gt;

For instance, if you fly 200 miles on a discount fare in business class (which has a 1.5x multiplier,) are the MQMs computed as:

&lt;code&gt;maximum (500, 200 * 1.5) = 500&lt;/code&gt;

or as:

&lt;code&gt;maximum (500, 200) * 1.5 = 750&lt;/code&gt;

Could, perhaps, someone who's flown Delta Business or First class since the beginning of 2015 on a leg of &amp;lt; 500 miles check their SkyMiles statement to see how much mileage they were credited for the leg?
I thought if you wanted to search for fare prices from one city for a specific date to anywhere under a specific price Momondo, Google Flights or Skyscanner are the stuff to use but they don't work on my Android phone. Are there any apps to have this search option for Android?

We fly from UK to Canada, then after a few days we travel to Alaska for a cruise. When the cruise finishes in Alaska, we travel back to Canada and then home. In applying for our ESTAs, I said we will be in transit. Did I do the right thing? If not, can I amend for free?
Both UPS and FedEX have a &quot;hold at depot&quot; option. You put your name on the package but their address plus &quot;c/o UPS hold at depot&quot;.

The downside is the depots are usually in industrial parks near the airport with a complete lack of public transportation. You will need a car to go get it.

The delivery/pickup window is also limited - after 3-4 days they will send the package back.

If it can go regular mail you can use general delivery (as it is known in the US; also known as &lt;em&gt;poste restante&lt;/em&gt; in much of the rest of the world). This doesn't work in big cities, but in smaller towns with only one post office they just put the package on the shelf until you show up. 

If you are near either border there are receiving warehouses that will accept nearly anything. You will be charged a (reasonable) receiving and daily storage fee.
I have been in the US for 2 months and 20 days. I have 10 days left on my ESTA.

I would like to extend my stay for non-medical reasons. Is there any way to do this? Can I apply for a brand new ESTA while still in my previous ESTA?

Otherwise, can I exit the country to Canada and come back 1 or 2 days later with a new ESTA?
Note: I am not a Canadian citizen.
While the phrase &quot;transit&quot; is not clarified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/WebHelp/ESTA_Screen-Level_Online_Help_1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ESTA Online help&lt;/a&gt; it is amply clarified on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/other/transit.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;transit visa&lt;/a&gt; page:


  A passenger embarking from a foreign port on a cruise ship or other vessel which is proceeding to another country, other than the United States, but during the course of the journey, the vessel makes port in the United States with no intention of landing in the United States.


So: you are not in transit for sure. However, updating this kind of info in ESTA is easy and painless and for free. Look at ree-nyc's answer in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k7840031-Flight_No_on_ESTA-Air_Travel.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.
I am German citizen and I am in USA for 9 month with student exchange visa. MY visa expires on 5/13/2015. College told me that I can be 30 days more in USA after visa expired. I bought ticket to fly from Toronto to Germany on 06/17/2014. I have 2 questions:

&lt;ol&gt;
If I leave USA my last permitted day ( 30 days after visa expired) on 06/13/2015 and stay in Canada until my flight ( 4 days) , do I can have  any problems to get  visa waiver entry in Canada as German tourist for 4 days on 6/13/2015?
Can  I leave USA after my student exchange visa expired, for example on  5/15/2015, go to Canada for one day  and reentry back to USA as a tourist with 90 days visa waiver program?
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
That's perfectly legal. You have a flight out of Canada and you only stay 4 days. Can't see a problem. Except... be very careful on flying the last day of your allowed stay because if there's a problem with your flight to Toronto and you are rebooked on a flight on the next day then you will get an overstay and lose your VWP rights for &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; and will need to apply for a B1/B2 visa ongoing. There's no mercy here. Noone cares it's not your fault. Absolutely noone. Neither the airline nor the CBP. Of course, if you are going on land then it's all fine.
Someone already asked this from the CBP &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120315213348AA7hUir&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120315213348AA7hUir&lt;/a&gt; and here's the reply:
&lt;/ol&gt;


  once your grace period has expired you are required to make a meaningful departure back to your home country. If you travel to a contiguous territory or adjacent island and try to reenter the US you could be denied entry


Pay attention to the word &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; and do not hang your hopes on &quot;could&quot;.

Edit: in general, do not try to outsmart the CBP. No, you are not the first to think of it and if it's even slightly tricky then it's easier to presume it's forbidden. Even if you cooked up something truly convoluted that the CBP haven't seen yet (good luck) the immigration officer you meet can deny you entry just because (s)he doesn't like your convoluted trick without needing to give much of a reason to anyone and you have no appeal. The whole process is not in your favor.
You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pay for a porter, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/45653/26164&quot;&gt;Mark Mayo suggested&lt;/a&gt;, but I would personally rather use a baggage cart, or trolley, even if I had to pay for one. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heathrowairport.com/heathrow-airport-guide/services-and-facilities/trolleys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;According to Heathrow's website&lt;/a&gt;, they're free to use in Heathrow airport.


  Baggage trolleys are provided for your use free of charge in key areas
  around the terminal buildings.  
  
  Arriving passengers will find plenty of
  trolleys in baggage reclaim, and these can be taken to the car park,
  bus station or rail station access points.  
  
  Trolleys are also provided
  on the departures concourse. Please note that they can't be taken
  through security control.  
  
  In the interests of safety, please don't let
  children ride on the trolleys.


They should look something like this:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4bNOm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;baggage carts in an airport&quot;&gt;

(&lt;em&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carts.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)

Depending on the size of your bags, you should be able to fit all or most of your bags on the cart, if you're careful; the one or two that don't fit can either get their own cart, or can be towed by hand. Done!
I recently booked someone from HNL to XNA on one reservation (one PNR).

When he was at the airport trying to check-in his luggage with United Airlines to his final destination the agent told him that he would have to re-check his luggage at Reno Airport with American Airlines.

Why is that?

  Will the US embassy or any EU embassy accept this as a proof of fund
  since it is as good as cash in my checking account (I can provide the
  embassy with a credit card monthly report which shows this)? I
  searched and found nothing even closely related to this.


No.

A credit card is a liability and is not considered &quot;funds&quot; for the purposes of proving financial sufficiency for visa purposes.

Only a bank statement and (if employed) a salary certificate are accepted as proof of funds:


  Recommended documents: U.S. immigration law requires that nonimmigrant
  visa applicants present evidence of strong economic, familial and/or
  social ties to a residence outside of the United States to which they
  are compelled to return. Applications unable to demonstrate such ties
  will be refused. The Consular Section recommends providing the
  following documents that can demonstrate such ties:
  
  
  Proof of employment
  Salary certificate 
  Bank statement(s) demonstrating sufficient funds for travel
  Previous passport showing prior international travel
  


There are some countries which require you to show proof of funds when giving you a visa on arrival; and here they do accept a valid credit card as proof of funds.
I just added a tag for &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/fare-class&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'fare-class'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;fare-class&lt;/a&gt; since I saw a question about them and thought it's a frequent enough topic in air travel even though I didn't know exactly what it was.

I guess it's something more technical used by airlines but only pretty savvy fliers really know properly.

I tried to look it up on Wikipedia but there's no article on it though it is used in other articles. Google instead offered me two Wikipedia articles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare_basis_code&quot;&gt;Fare basis code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_class&quot;&gt;Travel class&lt;/a&gt; one of which is probably another word for the same thing, but I'm still not sure, so why not ask a bunch of experts like all of you?

My guess is it's the former and that non savvy fliers would kind of assume that it's the latter but is actually more technical?
I applied for my UK tourist visa on 30th March and got an SMS saying my application has been sent to the embassy. I haven't heard anything since. Any idea how long they typically take for processing or the next update? Because there is no way to track it online.
I am an Indian passport holder got my schengen Business visa approved from Belgian consulate. At the time of applying visa, i have produced my travel itenary as, Norway (1N) --&gt; Belgium (14N) 

now due to some reason I have to reschedule it and will be like:
Norway: 1N
Finland: 2N
Sweden: 4N
Belgium: 8N

Can somebody guide me if this is OK? or do i have to follow some procedure?
For a detailed discussion of what is or isn't allowed, you can refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13362/should-my-first-trip-be-to-the-country-which-issued-my-schengen-visa/44782#44782&quot;&gt;Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/44258/can-i-change-my-route-and-hotel-reservation-after-getting-a-schengen-visa&quot;&gt;Can I change my route and hotel reservation after getting a Schengen visa?&lt;/a&gt; and all the linked questions.

In your case, if your visa has enough validity (i.e. it must be valid for the whole period you would be in the Schengen area and authorise at least 15 days of stay, ideally a few more) and the purpose of the trip is still the same, it should not be problem. Belgium is still your main destination and you will still enter and leave through the same countries so no reason the change should be an issue either during the trip or afterwards.

If your visa cannot cover the whole journey (i.e. it does not allow 15 days of stay or it would expire before the end of your trip), then you need another one. There is no simple established procedure to get an extension, you will need to get in touch with the consulate, possibly start a new application from scratch.
The &lt;strong&gt;fare basis&lt;/strong&gt; is the airline's identifier of your exact air fare.  This is usually an impenetrable looking 7-to-8 letter string like &lt;code&gt;TA2PXOW&lt;/code&gt;.

The extended version of this is the &lt;strong&gt;fare construction&lt;/strong&gt;, which adds in key details like what flight from where to where this air fare is for.

The &lt;strong&gt;fare class&lt;/strong&gt; is simply the first letter of the fare basis, which identifies &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/36049/how-to-know-a-flight-is-not-full/36050#36050&quot;&gt;the &quot;bucket&quot; of seats the fare is in&lt;/a&gt; and often maps directly to how many frequent flyer miles you'll get for the flight.  This is also known as &lt;strong&gt;booking class&lt;/strong&gt; or, confusingly, &lt;strong&gt;ticket class&lt;/strong&gt;.

Finally, &lt;strong&gt;travel class&lt;/strong&gt; is the class of the physical seat you end up in on the plane: first, business, premium economy, economy, etc.

An illustrated example of all four for the same ticket, from long to short:

Fare construction: &lt;code&gt;CPT TK X/IST TK NYC 406.06 TA2PXOW NUC 406.06 END ROE 10.146090 XT 1.60EV 2.00UM 18.70WC 32.40ZA 6.80TR 5.50YC 7.00XY 5.00XA 17.20US 278.40YR&lt;/code&gt; (Cape Town on Turkish Airways transfer at Istanbul on Turkish Airways to New York City $406.06 for fare basis TA2PXOW ...)

Fare basis: &lt;code&gt;TA2PXOW&lt;/code&gt;

I have a multiple entry Schengen business visa issued by Switzerland which will expire in July. Can I travel to Switzerland next week for work and then travel again to France for work at the beginning of July for a week? Or do I have to apply for another visa at the French Consulate?
I'm travelling to Amsterdam this month &amp;amp; some other countries in Europe but my longer stay will be in Amsterdam so I've already issued Multi Schengen visa from Netherlands but on my way to Amsterdam I will transit for 12 hours in Frankfurt because I booked with Lufthansa so is it ok to get out of Frankfurt airport to visit my uncle during these 12 hrs transit who lives in Frankfurt? or will this cause me a problem because my first entry should be Amsterdam?
OK ... I got this reply from UK Immigration and Visas Enquiry:

&quot;If you intend to both visit and transit the UK, you should apply for both a
transit and a visitor category UK visa, as per your purpose of coming to
the UK. Please, be advised that you must be holding a valid UK visa fit for
your purpose of coming to the UK to be able to enter or transit the UK.&quot;
No matter what you do, you will enter the Schengen area in Frankfurt. Flights to Amsterdam and other destinations in the Schengen area depart from another set of gates than flights out of the Schengen area and you will have to go through a passport check and get an entry stamp to reach them.

By contrast, when you land in Amsterdam, there won't be any passport check as you are already in the Schengen area.

So you might as well leave the transit area of the airport in Frankfurt if you wish. You will need a boarding pass to be able to get back in and should allow some time to clear security before catching your flight to Amsterdam.
Two people have suggested that porters are available AT the luggage carousel.&lt;br&gt;
But I'd be surprised if porters are allowed t be in the customs controlled area for international flights.&lt;br&gt;
If so, problem solved, if $ cost is OK.  

However, I'd strongly expect that a lady travelling alone who could not manage to fit all bags on one trolley, would attract offers of assistance from a number of people if seen struggling to push two carts at once. You'd get my help (as would anyone in that situation) and I'd expect an adequate number of equally helpful people on most flights.

Failing that - I suspect that asking the cabin staff at point of departure from the aircraft would result in some sort of assistance. 

I know I could fit 5 bags of any size on any trolley - but most people stand clear&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/OldGreyGuy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;when they see me coming&lt;/a&gt; at the best of times :-). If I knew I HAD to do this I'd take a roll of parcel tape (which I usually carry anyway) to assist me in fitting 5 bags on one trolley. It would look unusual, but it would work if they did not fit stably by themselves. I also use tape with &quot;ocean jumping bags&quot; as required - see below. 

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Portable self help:&lt;/strong&gt; When making international hops and luggage refuses to tidily fit into 'normal' cases my family uses what we term &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Ocean Jumping bags&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. That's just a fun name for 'anything cheap light and BIG that you can rapidly fit lots and lots of stuff into&quot; - so these can be anything that works, BUT ours usually look like this the picture below.&lt;br&gt;
In many countries you can buy large flexible polyester (I think) zipped bags that are &quot;strong enough&quot; but which provide minimal protection for contents by themselves. However, you can fit two or maybe three largish &quot;ordinary bags inside one of these and push various bits and pieces around the bags - which makes fitting things on trolleys and keeping them together that much easier. I may tape the filled bag with parcel tape as required to stop it being too floppy. Pretty they are not - but they serve the need very well indeed.  You can even, if you really have to, drag one of these along a floor or even smooth concrete without damage to the bags inside. (Don't overdo it). 

I have described ocean jumping bag use in more detail in my answer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/23031/how-can-i-minimize-the-weight-of-the-suitcase-of-my-checked-in-luggage/23075#23075&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - but this is what typical ones look like.

Your visa is generally valid for trips to France and other countries in the Schengen area. Provided it is a multiple-entry visa and you already used it for its main purpose, going to France is perfectly fine, even if the purpose is different.

It's not likely to come up but it's best to have all the documentation you would need for a fresh visa application (itinerary, proof of financial means, accommodation, return ticket…) with you when crossing the border so that if there is any doubt about your trip, you can easily show that you still fulfil all the requirements to visit the Schengen area.

If it was a single entry visa or you hadn't use it before, it's more delicate because it might appear as if you lied to get a business visa that you always intended to use for other purposes. But that's not an issue in your situation as you would already have used the visa for its main purpose.

&lt;h1&gt;Update 1 August 2015&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Schengen&lt;/h2&gt;

The most recent edition of the Schengen guidance contains this text (a screen cap is being used so that the information will persist if the link is changed)...

&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/viGL5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/viGL5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Item (b) in this list explicitly states that credit card statements are acceptable as evidence.  

This makes &lt;em&gt;some portions&lt;/em&gt; of my original answer (and other people's answers to this question) wrong.  Specifically, statements about the &lt;strong&gt;EEA/Schengen&lt;/strong&gt; visa process that discuss credit card statements are not correct.  

&lt;strong&gt;Credit card statements can be used for Schengen applications.&lt;/strong&gt;

Portions of the answer dealing with the UK remain correct (verified with guidance 1 Aug 2015), especially the paragraph about 'subsisting and genuine'.  The original answer is kept intact so that comparisons can be made.

More info at &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14514&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Schengen Borders Code&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Previous Answer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/h2&gt;

I will answer for the UK (and implicitly for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;EEA&lt;/a&gt;, where there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52013PC0045&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;intersecting regulations&lt;/a&gt; and shared agreements).  Since your question is useful to a very broad audience I'll take it from the top.

&lt;strong&gt;The Letter of the Law&lt;/strong&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/22/contents/enacted&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;rules laid down by Parliament&lt;/a&gt; are shown in this image...

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/gjQqB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the letter of the law&quot;&gt;

There is nothing stated about how to demonstrate the person's capacity to 'maintain and accommodate'; so from a &lt;em&gt;strictly legal viewpoint&lt;/em&gt; there's no requirement to show anything at all.  &lt;em&gt;Legally&lt;/em&gt;, they do not even require the applicant to submit a passport.

&lt;strong&gt;The Policy&lt;/strong&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/general/general-election-timetable-2015/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;current government&lt;/a&gt; has interpreted the above law to formulate their policy on how an applicant demonstrates financial capacity.  The relevant policy is shown below...

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jD0JR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the policy&quot;&gt;

Additionally, there are intersecting regulations about the provenance of the funds (i.e., whether the money was obtained in a lawful way) and the ownership of the funds (i.e., that the money is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;liquid form&lt;/a&gt; and actually available to the applicant).  It goes without saying that the money should be easily convertible to Sterling or Euro from within the EEA.

In order to keep things uniform on a global basis, they keep a list of banks which are regulated in a way that's roughly compatible to EEA regulation.  Paypal (and other related internet wallets) is not on that list.  They also keep a list of banks and financial houses from which they will &lt;em&gt;refuse&lt;/em&gt; to consider statements.  Paypal is not on that list either, but it's useful to note that statements from just any bank will not always be successful.  Schengen refusals on these grounds simply use the '&lt;em&gt;evidence not reliable&lt;/em&gt;' check box.  UK refusal formulae goes along the lines of &quot;&lt;em&gt;I am not satisfied that these funds...&lt;/em&gt;&quot;   There are no internet links to these lists and they change all the time, but you can obtain a current list using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;.  

Credit card statements, from anywhere, fail both the provenance and availability tests.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Paypal statements (MasterCard, American Express etc statements) will not be considered as a source of funds to meet the maintenance and accommodation requirement.  All of the same considerations apply to credit card statements as well.

Moreover, it can lead to a credibility hit if the statements suggest the funds are provananced unlawfully or in a way that eludes taxation.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Anecdotal Info&lt;/strong&gt;

I had a client once who had sent them his Ebay print-outs along with his login and password for evidence (this was &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; he was under client care).  This was misconceived and the application was refused on those grounds.

There's also this report...

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fdGxB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;anecdotal info&quot;&gt;

Source:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://talk.uk-yankee.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://talk.uk-yankee.com/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

The corollary to your question is...

&lt;strong&gt;What can Paypal/Credit Cards be used for in visa applications?&lt;/strong&gt;

Couples have used Paypal to demonstrate that their relationship is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420526/20150406_immigration_rules_appendix_fm_final.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;subsisting and genuine&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a wholly different area of visa applications and off topic here.

Ironically, they will accept fee payments from Paypal.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that it's a good way to get whipsawed on exchange rates and cash advance fees.

&lt;hr&gt;

Note: I used images for the law and policy because they are redrafting and overhauling those sites and there may be changes to the paragraph numbers and wording.  The law is found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/412242/Immigration_Rules_-_Part_2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The policies are found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/343241/2014_08_Visitor_Documents.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  

Rules on money laundering, taxation, and lawful provenance are shared across the EEA and you can expect refusals from all the member states.

Note: to avoid questions about the list of unacceptable banks, note that banks that operate within the US (Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, etc) regulatory framework are ok. Some (but not all) banks on the Indian subcontinent and Africa are on the list for example. Some banks in the Middle East are embargoed and for those cases you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;speak with a lawyer&lt;/a&gt;.

Note: they are not going to accept that kind of evidence (Paypal, credit cards, stock certificates, IRA accounts, etc).  Whether they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; or whether somebody can clear all of the hurdles with that kind of evidence or whether it's fair are all tantamount to debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
Because United and American do not have Interline Agreements in place. 

Interline agreements address the issues of transfering passenger data from one airline to the next, which in turn effects the transfer of baggage. If two airlines do not have an agreement, then bags will have to be claimed and then rechecked with the next airline.

The lack of interline agreements also impedes issuing boarding passes for the other airline.

Unfortunately a number of flight booking systems will build a trip using airlines without interline agreements in place, resulting in travel headaches for the passenger.
The Home Office provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://visa-processingtimes.homeoffice.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;a tool (in beta version) to estimate the time your application will take&lt;/a&gt;. The announced duration is in business days.

For General Visit visas from New Delhi, 98% of applications take 10 business days or less. You should go through the estimation process with your specific situation (since I don't know your precise situation). But a priori that's not too bad you got no answer yet.

It has been only 4 business days so far, usually 5 applications in 6 are processed within this timeframe. Last Friday and today (Monday) were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays&quot;&gt;bank holidays&lt;/a&gt; in the UK so the embassy employees were not working. I didn't find if there is any Indian holiday, if so it would make the process even longer. Your application may take another 10 calendar days without it being abnormally long.
Recently I had to cancel a flight and rebook because changing the date would have cost more than getting a new flight, so is there any way/trick to change flight dates with low fees ?
No, you can not extend your stay, unless it is some sort of emergency like hospitalization, canceled or delayed flight for more than 24 hours, etc &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1024/~/how-to-extend-my-visa-waiver-program-stay-in-the-u.s.-if-there-is-an-emergency&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;help.cbp.gov&lt;/a&gt;

ESTA is usually granted for 2 years or until your passport expires (whichever comes earlier), so depending on when yours started it is possible, that you may not have to apply again &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1197/~/esta--general-esta-renewal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;help.cbp.gov&lt;/a&gt;

However, one of the conditions for granting the entry is that your travel may not terminate in adjacent country (like Canada, Mexico or any of the Carribean islands) &lt;a href=&quot;https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/WebHelp/ESTA_Screen-Level_Online_Help_1.htm#vwp3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;esta.cbp.dhs.gov&lt;/a&gt;

Also, note that having an ESTA does not automagically grant you entry - that decision made by the CBP official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/frequently-asked-questions-about-visa-waiver-program-vwp-and-electronic-system-travel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.cbp.gov&lt;/a&gt;

Therefore, you would have to travel some place else then Canada in order not to violate the rules. And you better be prepared to give a good answer to CBP official asking you why you are back so soon.
Almost every airline offers a flexible and a non-flexible fares, with well-thought prices determined to get as much money out of your wallet as possible. And the difference between these flexible/non-flexible fares, which you apparently qualify as &quot;significant extra cost&quot; may in fact be lower than the difference between two flights offered by different travel agents. So this is relative to the airline, flight and even reseller you pick. There is no airline providing a really better deal.

But in your question I read more, how to get a ticket with the right conditions for cancelling/changing?

My answer is to recommend you to read the conditions before buying, and estimate how likely you are to change your flight. This might sound basic, but I think these few cases often work:


You know for sure when you fly, because it depends on stricter conditions, like getting holidays from your employer which are not changeable. In this case, just take the non-refundable ticket. The main reason you would want to change your flight is because you have a family issue, or something important enough so that you would be willing to pay hundreds of dollars to get a different flight.
You do not know yet when you will fly, but at some point you  will know, maybe because your trip depends on other people's schedule. You have two choices, you can compare the prices between them. The first is to wait until later. Some airlines do not increase their prices by a lot, so it may be worth waiting. The second option is to pay for a flexible ticket, it depends again on what the airline offers. Compare the price of a last-minute ticket with a flexible ticket.
You know when you fly out, but not when you fly back, most likely because you leave for a long time. In this case, you can find an open-return ticket, even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/28925/no-more-open-returns&quot;&gt;they may become rarer&lt;/a&gt;, or you can look at flexible tickets or even buy two one-way tickets (most airlines price these very high, so that might be the worst option).
The last common case I am thinking about is that you need a high flexibility, whatever the reason (it never happened to me, so I cannot figure a reason). In that case, you can wait for the last minute, or get a flexible ticket.


In the end, remember that all this is a matter of pricing. Airlines price their tickets, flexible options or cancelling fees depending on how much people are willing to pay. So you should determine how much you would pay for your flexibility.
Recently I considered cancelling a ticket for an emergency. The cancelling or changing fee were almost as high as just buying a new ticket. But this was an emergency, so I had no choice, and so would be willing to pay. For other cases, you can usually figure when booking what your flexibility is worth in terms of money.
I will be traveling on a family holiday to Paris. During this trip I need to have some (short) videoconf (Skype/Google hangout) calls. There is no option to do this at the place where I stay.
Since I will need to talk, I guess an internet cafe/coworking place is not an option. 

What are my options to engage in a video conference call, if it is not possible to do so at the place where I stay in Paris?
I am planning to travel from Liege to Paris. The Thalys (train) has this route direct but although they announce very good prices, if bought in advance, I can never find them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thalys.com/be/en/&quot;&gt;Thalys website&lt;/a&gt;.

Traveling by bus just takes too long. I am not even sure there is a direct connection. At least I couldn't seem to find one.  Using a bus would probably require traveling first to Brussels probably.

Are there any other ways of combining trains to arrive in Paris, as a compromise between the expensive Thalys and the snail bus?

Any other alternatives that might sound interesting are welcome (Eg: how to get the cheapest fare in Thalys or a direct bus connection from Liege).
How about car sharing?

In terms of time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rome2rio.com/s/Li%C3%A8ge/Paris&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according to Rome2Rio you are an hour slower than the Thalis&lt;/a&gt;, but the fare is a lot cheaper. Moreover your trip doesn't have to be organised too far in advance, and the price does not vary dependingly.
Actually, I have done that for my girlfriend before. I sent her my bank statement, letter mentioning that I'll be responsible all the expenses (My bank statement shows enough fund for 50 Euro per days for the entire visit for two people) and my passport. Also, she needed to show bank statement as well but her balance wasn't enough. We weren't married we were just boyfriend and girlfriend.

She submitted everything and they questioned about our relationship a bit, like how we met, how long we have been in this relationship. However, eventually she got the visa. I cannot say for sure that this would work for you as well. I'm just telling you about my personal experience.

Eurolines has a direct service between Li�ge and Paris. It's a 6 hours ride.

The best strategy to get cheap Thalys tickets is to book early enough. There is only a very limited number of very cheap seats. 
I am a big fan of cycle sharing plan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.velib.paris&quot;&gt;velib&lt;/a&gt; in Paris. However, on our next trip to Paris I will be traveling with company, where cycling is not an option. 
I just learned of the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autolib.eu/stations/&quot;&gt;auto lib&lt;/a&gt;', which is quite similar to velib, but with electric cars. Their plans seems reasonable.

However, one of the disadvantages of velib is that at times finding a drop off point with available slots, can be a challenge. I wonder how this is with auto lib'. At the velib' stands there are maps showing nearby drop off points. 

I wonder how this works with auto lib'. I guess getting out of your car to read a panel, while you block the street because of the lack of parking space is not really advisable.

More general, does autolib' cater tourists, or is it more for the &quot;riverains&quot;?
There are two logical answers - one a lot cheaper than the other:


office hire. If this is an important call, you could look at hiring office space for a half a day. There are various companies that offer this service. A very quick search showed me companies like instantoffices.com - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instantoffices.com/en/fr/office-space/paris?for=0-3&amp;amp;size=1&quot;&gt;http://www.instantoffices.com/en/fr/office-space/paris?for=0-3&amp;amp;size=1&lt;/a&gt;
headset. I have successfully used this option in busy locations, such as internet cafes. A good headset will pick up your voice and very little else, and only you will be able to hear the person speaking to you


Both will need wifi, but that should be relatively straightforward.
Although United and American probably &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have an interline baggage agreement (most of the larger IATA members do), and are probably &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; legally and operationally of transferring bags directly, it is up to the discretion of each airline whether or not to do so. And most US carriers have been increasingly reluctant to do so over the last few years as they have collected more of their revenue from baggage fees.

&lt;hr&gt;

Thirty years ago, when airlines were much smaller, there were no alliances and few express carriers, and the major carriers mostly operated on a high-cost, high-revenue business model, bag interlining was common, and done as both a courtesy and a necessity. Nowadays, fewer passengers need to interline, and more importantly, baggage fees have become an important part of an airline's revenue.

In 2011 and 2012, the US Department of Transportation handed down new regulations relating to baggage fees; to prevent passengers from having to pay multiple sets of baggage fees and manage multiple sets of baggage allowances, over a multi-carrier itinerary, they would only pay one fee and get one allowance. That introduces a risk that a carrier might not collect as much in fees as it could; by refusing to check in a bag for an entire itinerary, it can still collect the maximum. Thus, this was the proximate excuse for airlines to make interlining bags more difficult. Some, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2012/12/04/alaska-airlines-to-no-longer-allow-interlining-bags-on-separate-reservations/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-air-lines-skymiles/1401060-new-baggage-rules-january-2013-postponed.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;, backed down in light of furious consumer protests; others, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.hawaiianairlines.com/help/pages/interline-baggage-statement.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/us-airways-dividend-miles-pre-consolidation/1368485-announcement-usairways-discontinues-interline-bag-check-split-tickets.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;US Airways&lt;/a&gt;, stuck it out. I haven't uncovered anything specific about American or United on this particular issue, but in light of the shift in the industry, it wouldn't surprise me that they are moving to limit interlining operationally, if not a matter of announced policy.

Personally I have used the service a couple times when public transport was not an option (nighttime, distance, etc) and everything went smoothly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://regis.decamps.info/blog/2012/05/j-ai-teste-autolib-pour-vous/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Other reviews on the web will tell you a different story.&lt;/a&gt; It will be up to you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordreference.com/fren/faire%20la%20part%20des%20choses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;faire la part des choses&lt;/a&gt;.
I am planning to travel from Cologne (K�ln) to Prague. Some one suggested me to search for some cheap flight. But, I want to avoid this. What are the other best possibilities to travel from K�ln to Prague (best means cheap and time saving)?
If it has to be simultaneously cheap and time-saving, it will be hard to beat the plane.

You may consider a trip by bus. It takes roughly 10 hours and is probably cheaper than the plane if you plan on a short notice. See e.g. here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.busradar.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.busradar.com/&lt;/a&gt;

10 hours is also the duration of a day-time train, via Berlin. There are combined train/bus routes, via N�rnberg or Mannheim, sold by the Deutsche Bahn. Travel time is a bit less than 8 hours via N�rnberg and approximately 10 hours via Mannheim. If you book in advance and/or on less busy dates, these options can be quite cost effective.

There is also a direct night train from Cologne to Prague. It is really time effective. You travel while you sleep. And if you book sufficiently in advance it will be pretty cheap (also considering the fact that the train ticket includes the accommodation).  
The fastest option is to take an ICE train to Nuremberg and travel onward by bus from there. Total travel time is around 7.5 hours. The ICE trains as well as most buses between Nuremberg and Prague are sold through Bahn.de, if you book well in advance you can get tickets for around €40, buying on departure at the station can cost upwards of €150. There is also a slower direct overnight train with similar pricing.

There several bus companies that offer direct buses from Cologne to Prague for around €30 to €60 euros regardless of time of booking. At least four different bus companies travel overnight and one by day. Travel time is 10-12 hours. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.busbud.com/en/bus-schedules/Cologne,NorthRhineWestphalia,Germany/Prague,HlavniMestoPraha,CzechRepublic#date=2015-04-12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Busbud&lt;/a&gt; lists departures and prices (full disclosure: I work on this project).

If you don't mind the organizational work, carpooling is an option, BlaBlaCar and Carpooling.co.uk are the main sites.
The best website to plan a trip in europe like an InterRail is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurorailplanner.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.eurorailplanner.com/&lt;/a&gt;
A little confused as I can't find a current flight via Reno connecting Hnl to xna.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flyxna.com/airlines-flights/airlines/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.flyxna.com/airlines-flights/airlines/&lt;/a&gt; 

However assuming that it is actually via Las Vegas. I looked at the actual operating airlines, so American flights could actually be operated by Envoy air or Mesa Air branded as American eagle, and the United flights as Expressjet branded as United Express. 

Interestingly Expressjet operate flights for American, United, and Delta

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expressjet.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.expressjet.com&lt;/a&gt; 

So whilst interlining arrangements may still exist between the two top teir airlines, I would suspect that the small regional carriers operating these branded flights might not have such agreements.  

I found on the United airlines website baggage page the following wording 

Baggage can be checked through to the final destination if the separate ticketed itinerary includes Star Alliance member airline-operated flights. 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.united.com/CMS/en-US/travel/Pages/ChangedBagRulesOptionalServices.aspx#BagPolOthrCarriers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.united.com/CMS/en-US/travel/Pages/ChangedBagRulesOptionalServices.aspx#BagPolOthrCarriers&lt;/a&gt; 

American is not star alliance.  I realise this doesn't answer the question fully but it might shed some light.
My American debit card has been inserted into ATMs in at least twelve European countries. It has &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; surcharge (one reason I choose it, I use a different card inside the USA). I generally travel with about $200 US for an emergency if an ATM can't be found. Then I withdraw the equivalent of $200&amp;ndash;$300 in local currency. The &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; place I have had trouble finding an ATM is rural Czech Republic.

My debit card refunds any fees that the foreign bank charges for ATM use because I am a preferred customer. The only country where these fees weren&amp;rsquo;t waived for foreigners&amp;rsquo; cards was Ukraine, and then only some of the banks. (Unfortunately, the only ATMs at Kiev Borispol Airport had very high fees, which were refunded.)

I recommend carrying one&amp;rsquo;s usual amount of cash. Under no circumstances should you exchange money inside the USA. Our terrible rates and high fees are downright bizarre.
Any suggestions for wild camping in Poland?

I was planning a trip to Australia next month and was wondering: do I need to do anything/carry permits or prescription for everyday medicine like tylenol (acetaminophen), tums and Imodium? 

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/general-guidance-for-travellers-bringing-medicines-to-and-from-australia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Department of Health website&lt;/a&gt;

seems intimidating and tempts me not to carry any medicine with me. 
For those particular drugs, &lt;strong&gt;don't worry about it&lt;/strong&gt;: acetaminophen, calcium carbonate (Tums) and loperamide (Imodium) are widely available over the counter in Australia itself.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tga.gov.au/entering-australia&quot;&gt;page for visitors&lt;/a&gt;, and in particular its link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ocs-treaties-compliance-prohibited-impexp-precursor.htm&quot;&gt;entire list of prohibited substances&lt;/a&gt; (which doesn't contain any of those three), is useful for determining if you need any special permits.
I'm currently on a four-week trip with my parents. I have all flight, accommodation and transport booked up for our trip in Germany, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. We have just started our trip and I got pickpocketed and lost my passport. 

Anyone know if it is possible to continue doing the trip with an emergency travel document?

According to the Malaysian government website the emergency travel document is not recognized in Germany, Italy and Switzerland. It's my parents first trip in Europe and they really need me with them.
I travel in and out of Australia regularly with prescription medication, as well as over the counter stuff like paracetamol.

As long as the prescription stuff is labelled, they never worry (at most they ask if you have enough for your stay in the country).

I generally declare it anyway, but the over the counter stuff - there's a checkbox on the arrival form for bringing in medicines that 'might be restricted'.  To be safe I just declare everything, but as jpatokal has pointed out, none of the stuff you are bringing is on the list.

Fun fact: 90% of the time, declaring stuff seems to have a shorter line to get out the airport, so this works well for me ;) 
One option I recently found out about is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shipito.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shipito&lt;/a&gt;. It is a company that offers a USA address (in fact it has a few adresses for you to choose from) for shipping things you buy online. They can hold your stuff for up to 90 days and they will charge you 1 dollar (+ shipping costs) to deliver your goods anywhere in the world. 

I assume they can deliver in any american address, as well. You probably can pick up your stuff in their depots too, but perhaps, ship it to you may be cheaper than renting a car or a cab to go to one of their depots.
Is there a reliable list of airway companies that overbook flights? And, is there any shorter list of companies that do overbook, but when too many passengers show up, they deal fairly with it?

I had recently this problem with Iberia and was not amused. First the horrible surprise, then the horrible way they dealt with the case. 
Do you know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitfahrgelegenheit&quot;&gt;Mitfahrergelegenheit&lt;/a&gt; (Carpool)? Though it's more than just carpooling, it includes buses and trains. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is a good start.
From my experience and experiences of others, it's mostly safe and you also get to meet new people.
Truck stop is also Homeland Security, they aren't just looking for overloaded trucks. Be smart, pull thru the weigh station and save yourself a roadside inspection 10 miles down the road.
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://corporate.ryanair.com/about-us/passenger-charter/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ryanair Passenger Charter&lt;/a&gt; claims:


  Ryanair is the only airline in Europe that does not overbook its flights; therefore Ryanair has eliminated the possibility of passengers being denied boarding due to overbooking. However if for technical or immigration reasons, it becomes necessary to accommodate passengers on another flight, Ryanair will try to prioritize the needs of and minimise the delay to those passengers effected and provide compensation in line with Regulation EU261/2004.


For example on the latter, there are regulations for passengers : flight attendant ratio and if crew calls in sick and no replacement is available then yes some passengers will be removed from the plane. The other side of the coin, if they need to move crew and there are no seats available, you can be bumped again.

With that said, I am reasonably sure other airlines would tear Ryanair apart if this would be a lie so probably this is true and they are the only ones in Europe who do not overbook.

Edit: Check out this comment: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/1.3022473#vf-7598300001581&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/1.3022473#vf-7598300001581&lt;/a&gt; claiming WestJet never overbooked a flight in 20 years. WestJet spokespeople have repeatedly claimed it is their policy for eg &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/air-canada-ordered-to-increase-payout-to-bumped-passengers/article12191581/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/air-canada-ordered-to-increase-payout-to-bumped-passengers/article12191581/&lt;/a&gt; in here.

The US does not use the 90-in-180 day rule that is used in the Schengen area and by many other countries. Instead, once you have left North America (to include Canada, Mexico and various Caribbean islands) and/or returned to your home country, when you return to the US -- even if it is the next day! -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/194/~/visa-waiver-program---eligible-countries&quot;&gt;you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be admitted for another 90-day stay&lt;/a&gt;.

The catch is that on your subsequent entry you may be scrutinized more carefully. CBP is looking for people who are trying to game the system and covertly live in the United States. So you should carry all of the documents needed to show that this is a legitimate business trip, essentially the same as if you were applying for a visa. If your purpose is legitimate and the CBP officer is satisfied, you will be admitted.

  in Poland [...] any camp fire away from designated areas is illegal


so any wild camping will, at best, be tolerated.
What is the difference between a tatkal and premium tatkal ticket in Indian Railways?

I wanted a book a ticket in tatkal but it shows already the tickets are in waiting list. How is that possible?

Also how to know in advance whether a tatkal or a premium tatkal ticket is available for a particular train or not?
The main difference between Tatkal and Premium Tatkal is that Premium Tatkal is an &lt;strong&gt;Online Only&lt;/strong&gt; service.

According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.timesofindia.com/city/patna/Now-Tatkal-tickets-available-at-a-premium/articleshow/44525341.cms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Times of India&lt;/a&gt;


  Passengers can book premium Tatkal tickets online only on the pattern of airline fares - more the demand, higher the fare.
  
  According to a Railway Board official, premium Tatkal tickets are dynamically priced like air fares. The minimum premium fare is the basic train fare plus Tatkal charges, which vary from 10% to 30% depending on the class of travel, he said, adding the maximum limit for booking premium Tatkal ticket is 30% of the base fare or Rs400, whichever is higher.

Bring your Doctor's report in English and you are allowed to take 3 months of supply of your medicine to Country. 

Workarounds to use it for 6 months:
If you're using 5mg of some medicine, you may ask your Doctor to type 10mg daily usage on report. You may bring 10mg packs of 3 months supply. Take half everyday. You have 6 months supply. 

Australian customs are really serious you wouldn't want to mess with them. If you want to bring more do it at your own risk. 

Edit: If you ask to any doctor to sign a paper saying that you need to take those pills in English you may use it as Doctor's report. I filled my own report just asked a doctor friend of mine to sign it. 
If possible, drop the packaging, and carry it in the the cabin-luggage/side-bag. You are out-of-trouble. 

In very rare case, even if you questioned, say it is for personal usage. You are good to go.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, low-cost carriers usually don't overbook. 


  They are able to do this and remain profitable as the majority of their customers are tourists, instead of business fliers, and their tickets are non-refundable, thereby lowering the chances of passengers missing their flights.


Wikipedia mentions JetBlue as an example of a company which doesn't overbook flights. However their terms and conditions do mention the possibility of passengers being denied boarding, probably to accommodate for passengers who missed earlier flights, and transport of crew members to the destination airport. Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.jetblue.com/SRVS/CGI-BIN/webisapi.dll/,/http://help.jetblue.com/SRVS/CGI-BIN/webisapi.dll/,/?St=8,E=0000000000180230641,K=167,Sxi=3,t=casePrint,case=obj%28372529%29&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the JetBlue FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;:


  While JetBlue does not purposefully overbook flights, there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation.


Of course, not all low-cost carriers follow this policy. For example EasyJet does overbook its flights. For a more complete review, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.which.co.uk/news/2013/08/airline-overbooking-policies-revealed--331108/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here is a 2013 blog post on Which&lt;/a&gt; which analyses the policies of 14 airlines. Below is a summary (image courtesy of Which):

You have got some good answers already but if you want to explore what's possible with the train, one nifty tool is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ps.bahn.de/preissuche/preissuche/psc_start.post?dbkanal_007=L01_S01_D001_KIN0014_sparpreisfinder-content-button_LZ03&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DB “Sparpreis finder”&lt;/a&gt;. It's basically another interface to their booking engine but instead of specifying a time and seeing a handful of detailed connections ordered chronologically, you can specify a date and see all connections ordered by fare. You can also navigate easily from one day to the next. It's particularly useful if you are somewhat flexible regarding the date and want to find the cheapest discount fares on your route.

NB: My link is in German, I don't know if it's available in English. Most options should be self-explaining, the only somewhat counterintuitive thing is that to search trains to Prague, you first need to click “Start oder Ziel außerhalb Deutschlands” (point of departure or arrival outside Germany”), then leave “Ziel außerhalb Deutschlands” (destination outside Germany”) selected and choose “Tschechische Republik (CZE)”. When you come back to the main screen, the destination field will have been replaced with a list of Czech train stations.
So to clarify:


Your old passport is correct
Your old visa is correct
Your new passport has it wrong


It's definitely something you'll want to do, to prevent problems.  Yes, it'll likely be clear what has happened, but given how strict the US is - for their own passports, they offer a FREE, expedited service for correcting passports, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/services/correction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;are prioritised well above general passport applications&lt;/a&gt; - they'll expect the same from other citizens.

Ultimately, it'll come down to the discretion of the US border agent to decide if it's clearly just a mistake, and even then they're likely to give you a telling off for trying to travel with an incorrect travel document.

You probably don't want to leave it up to them, so I'd recommend getting it fixed ASAP, before you travel back to the US.
I'm flying from Riyadh to Orlando, USA (I have USA visa) with stops at Frankfurt International (FRA) and a 19 hours layover in Toronto (Canada) Pearson International Airport (YYZ) with Air Canada. 

Do I need a visa to enter Canada for short-term stays, including transit? Do I need to apply for visa to connect through or I will get the visa transit at airport?

I am a Jordanian Citizen with permanent residency in KSA.
According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_client.cgi?SpecData=1&amp;amp;VISA=1&amp;amp;HEALTH=1&amp;amp;NA=JO&amp;amp;AR=SA&amp;amp;PASSTYPES=PASS&amp;amp;DE=US&amp;amp;EM=SA&amp;amp;TR=CA&amp;amp;VT=00&amp;amp;user=STAR&amp;amp;subuser=STARB2C#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Timatic&lt;/a&gt; you will require a visa:


  Transit passengers are required to hold a passport or passport
  replacing document required to enter Canada. 
  
  Passport required.
  
  
  Passports and/or passport replacing documents must be valid
  for the intended transit period. 
  
  
  Visa required.
  
  Additional Information:
  
  
  Visitors are required to hold proof of sufficient funds to
  cover their stay and documents required for their next
  destination.
  
  
  Warning:
  
  
  Visitors not holding return/onward ticket could be refused
  entry.
  


So a transit or a short stay visa for Canada will be required.

Indeed, parking seems to a be a profitable business in Mexico City. The ones showing prices on them have been reviewed by community members, whilst the greyed-out ones have not. In my opinion a safe parking is one that is underground/off-the-street, manned possibly 24h or at least during the daytime. 

With these constraints, and your 300&lt;code&gt;MXN&lt;/code&gt; budget in mind you can see that one parking seem to fit your requirements: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.parkopedia.mx/parking/carpark/hermano_arolas_jos%C3%A9fina/06000/ciudad_de_m%C3%A9xico/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hermano Arolas Jos�fina at 224&lt;code&gt;MXN&lt;/code&gt; per 24h&lt;/a&gt;.

Do i need to get a canadian Visa?

Info on Canada website is a little confusing.
Unfortunately, this is most likely not possible to decline CDW at Europcar and get a better price. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/35813/ldw-lis-for-us-car-rental-booked-in-uk&quot;&gt;discussed this question about protection depending on the booking website&lt;/a&gt;, pricing of rental cars is pretty opaque. Depending on your residence country, on the rental company, on the location, and some possible other parameters (like temporary offers), the protections that are included in the base price may change. This does not mean that if the protections change, the price will change (in the linked question, if you book in the UK or in the US, the price is the same, but one has more protection).

In the specific case of Europcar, its FAQ mentions that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europcar.co.uk/EBE/module/render/faq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;CDW/LDW is usually included if booking from its UK website&lt;/a&gt; (you can search the FAQ for another website):


  A UK quote generally includes road tax, third party liability cover, VAT, CDW &amp;amp; TW


So if you want to get the better price without the CDW coverage, you should compare the different rental companies' offers without the CDW. I.e. it does not mean that if Europcar has the best price with CDW for your search, it also has the best price among all offers without CDW.
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://matrix.itasoftware.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ITA Matrix&lt;/a&gt; will let you search for this. (It doesn't let you book, but does tell you enough to let a travel agent recreate and book them for you, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8619/travel-agents-can-they-match-ita-travel-matrix-prices&quot;&gt;this question for details&lt;/a&gt;). Simply pop in several airport codes in the from and/or to boxes separated by commas, such as shown:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/J0x2j.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

Then on the search results see what was the cheapest combination. In this case, Brussels is our cheapest departure point, and combinations with different airports used are shown in red to highlight the change:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/OZVgI.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

My parents have B1/B2 visa and do they need Mexico visa if they want to visit Mexico (&amp;lt;10 days) during their stays at US?

When I had H1b visa, I visited Mexico without any Mexico visa. Again the same thing also goes with F1 visa. But I'm not sure about B1/B2 visa.

Any links or references would be really helpful.
I already have Schengen Visa, however, we added another country which differs from when I applied for visa. Will I have a problem when I enter?

I will be spending more time in the country that issued the visa and I will be both arriving and leaving through the same country that issued the visa. 

I actually received it for 15 days since my trip was tourism... is that normal?
I already have a Schengen visa when I applied I had hotel booked for the full length of my stay. I found a deal with an apartment through airbnb.com and booked the apartment and the hotel (about half the time on each). Will I have issues with immigration? What should I put on the immigration form?

My main concern is whether it is a problem to book two separate accommodations in the same country?
Also since the first accommodation is an apartment rental will I have any issues with immigration?
List the first address in the immigration form. Generally the officials don't care much about the address. Airbnb is fine as long as you have the receipt to show the booking.
Original itinerary Fr 13nights

would it be okay to change itinerary to:

Change to FR 6nights-&gt; IT 7nights -&gt; FR 1night

Already hold Schengen visa valid for 15 days.

Will I be in breach?
They do not need a visa. From the Mexican government's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inm.gob.mx/index.php/page/Paises_Visa/en.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:


  A foreign who has any of the following documents shall not require Mexican visa:&lt;br&gt;
  ...&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;b) Valid visa from the United States of America;&lt;/strong&gt;  

It is not a problem to have multiple accommodation arrangements for a single country as long as there is &lt;em&gt;coverage for the entire period&lt;/em&gt; and the arrangements dovetail with your itinerary.

If you already have the visa and have cancelled your original reservations you can prepare a revised itinerary and attach the booking confirmations.  If (when you land) the immigration officer wants to see it then you can show it and provide a verbal explanation about why there's a variation.

For your other question about whether an apartment rental through airbnb is acceptable accommodation: yes, it's fine as long as the confirmation is in order.  

Overall, you should bring along the documents you used to apply for your visa along with an updated itinerary and new confirmations.
If you don't need a visa to visit Canada, then you don't need one to transit through it. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;government of Canada page&lt;/a&gt; makes it simple to check your country. I checked Jordan for you, and you would need a visa to visit.

Of those who need a visa to visit, only four countries in the world qualify for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/twov/travellers.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Transit Without Visa&lt;/a&gt; through Canada:


Indonesia 
Thailand 
Taiwan 
Philippines


There are further restrictions such as the length of the connection, what airline you're on, and what airport and terminal you're going through, but none of these are relevant since you are not a citizen of one of these four countries. 

In addition there is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/ctp/eligibility.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;China Transit Program&lt;/a&gt; which has similar restrictions on airline, terminal, and so on plus you have to leave from particular cities in China. This program isn't relevant to you either but I mention it for completeness.

Bottom line: &lt;strong&gt;you will need a visa&lt;/strong&gt;. 

I recommend avoiding private party sites for visa information and sticking to government sites like the one I linked to above. They also provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/transit.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;instructions for getting a transit visa&lt;/a&gt;. If the URL does not end &lt;code&gt;.gc.ca&lt;/code&gt;, you are not on a Government of Canada site.
That's quite a big change and you would spend as much time in Italy than in France so it's really borderline but you are still using your visa for its original purpose and France is still the main destination and the country from which you should have applied for a visa so it should be OK. For a full discussion of the rules, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13362/should-my-first-trip-be-to-the-country-which-issued-my-schengen-visa/44782#44782&quot;&gt;Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/44258/can-i-change-my-route-and-hotel-reservation-after-getting-a-schengen-visa&quot;&gt;Can I change my route and hotel reservation after getting a Schengen visa?&lt;/a&gt; and all the linked questions.

That said, entering and leaving through France means it's very unlikely you will have any problem in practice. Unless they ask you about it, border guards might not even notice. Do have all the relevant documentation (hotels, list of sights you want to see, etc.) for Italy ready as well. That way, if there is any concern you can show that you really are a tourist and are not trying to abuse the visa.
Probably the only time you can expect your home country to get involved is when the crime you're accused of isn't a crime in your home country. For example, printing negative opinions about the government isn't a crime in the US, and they might help someone who was arrested for that in a country where it is. If you're accused of assaulting or robbing someone, you might get some consular assistance but don't expect to be immune from the laws of the country you're visiting.

Being deported to serve your sentence back at home is rare and needs a lot of diplomatic intervention. A lot. Being deported to be tried back home? Not going to happen. And most certainly not for stealing.
I'm travelling to Orlando for 14 nights at the end of August, for a nice holiday break. I travelled to Orlando last year in June, for 2 weeks. My question involves whether my visa waiver is still valid?

If so, do I just print it off again and take it to the airport in August, My hotel details will be different than last time? Is that something to be worried about?

Thanks
As for your alternative question on “how to get the cheapest fare in Thalys”: the b-europe.com website offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.b-europe.com/Travel/Promotions/LowestFares/GeneralLFF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;fare calendar&lt;/a&gt;. For each date, it shows the price of the cheapest tickets still available on that date. The cheapest possible fare for a trip from Liège-Guillemins to Paris Nord seems to be €29. These are always “Non Flex” tickets (color coded in green) meaning there’s no possibility of exchanges or refunds. There might be cheaper tickets because there’s a color code for “Promo” tickets (yellow), but I’m not seeing any on the fare calendar now (I’m not sure I ever have for the routes I’ve booked).

You can always book up to three months in advance, so today April 7th, you can book tickets up to July 7th. For that date, the cheapest offers I’m currently seeing are:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRSOE.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cheapest Ticket Prices Thalys Liege-Paris on July 7th&quot;&gt;

I’m not sure about the Liège-Paris route, but in my experience with other routes, these offers don’t last long, especially if you don’t want to travel on a very early or very late train. So your best bet is to book exactly three months in advance.
I have a multiple entry Belgium Schengen tourist visa for 30 days, however my travel plans have changed.. can I now goto Italy on the same visa or shall I apply for a fresh Schengen visa for Italy.. what are the pros and cons of travelling to Italy on a Belgium Schengen visa?

For ESTA duration Google has:  


  Your ESTA authorization is generally valid for multiple trips over a period of two years (starting the date that you are approved) or until your passport expires, whichever comes first*. This means that as long as you received an ESTA authorization to travel, you do not have to reapply during the validity period.  


From &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1126/~/esta---length-of-approval&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CPB&lt;/a&gt;:  


  *If you obtain a new passport or change your name, gender or country of citizenship, you will be required to apply for a new travel authorization. This is also required if one of your answers to any of the VWP eligibility questions changes.  The associated fee of $14 will be charged for each new application submitted.  


I am guessing, but I doubt it is expected that multiple trips will all be to stay at the same accommodation - and were that expected I think safe enough to expect in turn that that would be mentioned.

The &quot;generally&quot; part may be explained by changes in circumstances, such as a criminal conviction or sexually transmitted disease that would invalidate an ESTA, rather than anything more mundane. 
I like Gayot Fow's answer, and that's the safe strategy. That said, I have done modifications like this and more, and was never asked for the reservations etc while traveling.
Don't know what airlines you're referring to....but visiting a manned check-in desk is definitely the preferred option for MOST passengers. (Note: ryanair is an exception - all other airlines will allow you to seek help from a customer service representative).

Flight bookings these days can be complicated, and it's always best to seek assistance from the airline staff. Self-service compliments the whole check-in process, but should never be a complete substitute for dealing with airline staff. 
Due to China's visa rules I need to have a return flight booked in order to obtain a visa. But once I have the visa I am free to enter overland and not use the flight.

On my previous trip I had a travel agent in Vientiane, Laos book such a flight and hotel, print out the details, then cancel them, for a reasonable $3.

This trip in Ho Chi Minh with a much larger tourist zone than Vientiane and many more travel agencies, I can't find one that understands my needs.

So I guess I have to book the flight myself. Having not done this before I'm a bit worried about running into trouble cancelling the flight and spending money for real.

Which airline will allow me to book a flight to China from Vietnam online, then cancel it, with a simple process that I won't mess up, without a fee? (Or a very low fee.)
&lt;a href=&quot;http://hcmc.chineseconsulate.org/chn/lsfw/qz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here is the official visa page&lt;/a&gt; for the Chinese embassy in Saigon. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://hcmc.chineseconsulate.org/chn/lsfw/qz/t1099101.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;download a Word doc with English instructions&lt;/a&gt;; for the same information in HTML form &lt;a href=&quot;http://vn.china-embassy.org/chn/lsyw/t1072749.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;visit the Chinese consulate in Vietnam's official site&lt;/a&gt;, last updated 2008. Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://hcmc.chineseconsulate.org/chn/lsfw/bgxz/P020131114604417846674.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the English version of visa application form&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, direct link).

In addition to the obvious forms, photos, money and passport, you'll need...


  Documents showing the itinerary including air ticket booking record (round trip) and proof of a hotel reservation


You're going on a tourist (L) visa without an invitation letter, I assume. Get the airline ticket and cancel it after getting your visa. Do get a flight; it's possible for them to make a stink over having a boat or bus ticket instead and use that as an excuse to deny your application. Do the same with the hotel reservation, assuming you don't want to actually use it. 


  Proof of legal stay or residence status (applicable to those not applying for the visa in their country of citizenship)&lt;br&gt;
  If you are not applying for the visa in the country of your citizenship, you must provide the original and photocopy of your valid certificates or visa of stay, residence, employment or student status, or other valid certificates of legal staying provided by the relevant authorities of the country where you are currently staying.


You're an Australian applying inside Vietnam, so you'll need to provide proof you're there legally. They will need to physically see your Vietnamese visa and retain copies of it. It's prudent to also bring along copies of transit (flight, preferably) and accommodation receipts showing you've used mainstream methods to enter and stay in Vietnam. These would be a supplement to, not a replacement for, your visa.


  If you have obtained Chinese visas before and want to apply for a Chinese visa with a renewed foreign passport that does not contain any Chinese visa, you should present the photocopy of the previous passport's data page and the photo page if it is separate, as well as the previous Chinese visa page.


They want to see your previous Chinese visa. But unfortunately, it sounds like you don't have it. This almost certainly rules out obtaining a longer term, multiple entry visa for you, since Aussies need to have a previous visa to obtain the multiple entry one. Also, a grumpy agent who reads this extremely strictly might say you can't get a visa there at all and need to apply within Australia; if that happens just apply again at a different embassy.


  Is it up to me to provide evidence of my previous visits or do they just check my records?


It is most definitely up to you to provide this information. If you don't have it, the chance they will or can look it up is low. And even if they do see it in the computer, there is a significant chance that they'll discount it because you didn't properly submit a copy with your paperwork. Correct paperwork is correct obeisance to the Chinese government. You might get lucky, but I wouldn't expect this to work out in your favor. It bears remembering that &lt;a href=&quot;http://vn.china-embassy.org/chn/lsyw/t1072749.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;the consular officer will decide on whether or not to issue the visa and on its validity, duration of stay and number of entries in light of specific conditions of the applicant.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

However, there shouldn't be any problems getting the typical &quot;first time&quot; (short term, single or double entry) visa without having a copy of your previous visa. If you're willing, you could roll the dice and tick &quot;1 year / multiple entry&quot; and hope the computer records do it for you; if not, the embassy will probably automatically downgrade you to whatever you are eligible for (though the price difference will not be refunded). There is some risk of rejection, but you could just apply again for the less useful visa if they're being sticklers.

You need to show up in the morning in order to be seen, and the office is closed on Chinese holidays. May Day is coming up soon; it's May 1 - 3.


  Accepting applications for certificates, issuing time: Monday to Friday 08:30 - 11:00 ;&lt;br&gt;
  Chinese holidays (such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival, Qingming Festival, May Day, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day), the room is not external work visa. For other reasons, such as suspension of foreign work visas issued a circular room to advance.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://vn.china-embassy.org/chn/lsyw/qz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The official Chinese embassies in Vietnam website&lt;/a&gt; (different from and more general than the Saigon embassy's site) lists the following fees and service times (translation by Google):

&lt;h2&gt;Current information for Chinese visa application process in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam as of 8 April, 2015&lt;/h2&gt;

First the bad news. They only issue single-entry thirty-day tourist visas in HCMC, and I get the impression this will be the case also in Hanoi.

(There may be a chance Vietnamese or US citizens can get other types of visas here, since those nationalities have other special rules.)

For single-entry, thirty day visas, you'll need this paperwork...

(photo coming...)

Here are the prices (including for the visas which they don't issue at this consulate).

(photo coming...)

The consulate is open from 8:30am to 11:00am weekdays. After 11:00am no new customers can get in but everybody already waiting will be served.

  Only 3 kilometers apart


You can't exit on the other side of the runways, that's quite clear so if you just take this &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/bkn67&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/maps/bkn67&lt;/a&gt; section, it's already 3km and you are not yet on the other side of the airport. Then from the point you provide (or so) to the very outskirts of the town &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/wRIop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/maps/wRIop&lt;/a&gt; it's another 2km. So you are looking at a 6km+ walk irregardless whether a connection exists between the two sections.

Otherwise yes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/172314925#map=16/-20.4383/57.6912&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/172314925#map=16/-20.4383/57.6912&lt;/a&gt; there is a footpath and then unpaved roads where you need them.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/hAlcm.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenStreetMap of MRU&quot;&gt;
Since you're not using an agency, you'll need a credit card with a big enough limit. In order to get the confirmation in order, they will need to get the charge approved and posted to your account. When you cancel, you'll get a credit from them. Time it so that the debit and credit fall within the same billing cycle to avoid having to make a payment or accrue interest. Cancel well in advance of the flight, don't check in, and use the same website you used to book the ticket.

Booking with a Chinese carrier can be expensive. You're getting the money back (probably), but there will be a sizable charge (could easily be several thousand RMB) posted to your card. You may also incur foreign transaction or currency conversion fees from your card provider, quite possibly both coming and going, and these will not be refunded. 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airchina.com.cn/en/index.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Air China&lt;/a&gt; will let you cancel full fare economy class tickets for free, as long as you don't wait until the last minute to do it. I put together a sample ticket on their site from Ho Chi Minh to Guangzhou, leaving May 7 and returning May 8. Full fare economy price: ~8500CNY (~1400USD). To see the details of their cancellation policy, you have to actually select an itinerary through the booking interface, because the refund policies vary by ticket type.


  1.3    Rebooking Fee (per change): free to change/rebook. Passengers will also need to pay the difference in fare (if any). For tickets booked on Air China official website, rebooking can be done through the official website or 95583. For tickets booked through other channels like Taobao flagship store, rebooking can be done through 95583 only. [95583 is a special service number you can call only via a Chinese mobile carrier.]
  
  1.6    Refund fees (children’s ticket are subject to the same standard that apply to adult tickets): Free to refund. For refunds of partially used tickets, the refund amount will be calculated after deducting the fare and taxes corresponding to the flight segment(s) used.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airchina.com.cn/en/investor_relations/international_trans/08/15650.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The official Air China refund policy states&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;emphasis&lt;/strong&gt; added):


  10.3 Voluntary Refunds&lt;br&gt;
  10.3.1 If you are entitled to a refund of your Ticket for reasons other than those set out in 10.2, the amount of the refund shall be:&lt;br&gt;
  10.3.1.1 if no portion of the Ticket has been used, an amount equal to the fare paid, less any reasonable service charges or cancellation fees;&lt;br&gt;
  10.3.1.2 if a portion of the Ticket has been used, the refund will be an amount equal to the difference between the fare paid and the applicable fare for travel between the points for which the Ticket has been used, less any reasonable service charges or cancellation fees.&lt;br&gt;
  10.5 Right to Refuse Refund&lt;br&gt;
  10.5.1 We may refuse a refund where application is made after the expiry of the validity of the Ticket.&lt;br&gt;
  10.5.2 &lt;strong&gt;We may refuse a refund on a Ticket which has been presented to us, or to Government officials, as evidence of intention to depart from a country, unless you establish to our satisfaction that you have permission to remain in the country or that you will depart from that country by another carrier or another means of transport.&lt;/strong&gt;


That last bit is most likely intended for trying to cancel the return trip after arriving in China, but could technically be employed in your case.

The Air China website is actually quite good as Chinese e-commerce platforms go. To cancel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airchina.com.cn/en/service/check-in/index.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;go to the &quot;online check in&quot; page&lt;/a&gt;, click the cancel tab, enter your information, and confirm through. If there's some problem with the site, it shouldn't be an issue getting English language &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airchina.com.cn/en/contact_us/hotline.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;customer support via their call centers&lt;/a&gt;, but you may need to make an international call as I don't know if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airchina.com.cn/en/contact_us/asia_pacific.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vietnam offices&lt;/a&gt; have English speaking reps. You can probably also cancel by logging in and viewing your details, but I can't verify that at this time.

For a much lesser charge, ITA Matrix lists China Southern as the cheapest carrier at ~7m VND (~325 USD) (same dates and airports). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csair.com/en/order/lvkexuzhiguonei.shtml#d14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Their official policy&lt;/a&gt; doesn't list anything terribly specific either way about cancellations, though it does sound relatively reasonable. After actually picking out an itinerary on their site, I was able to find this (translation by Google; no link as it's JSP generated):


  Cancel&lt;br&gt;
  Totally unused tickets&lt;br&gt;
  Cancellation / Refund charges of $ 20.00 (usd).&lt;br&gt;
  Partially used ticket&lt;br&gt;
  Cancellation / Refund charges of $ 40.00 (usd).


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elong.net/flights/RefundPolicy.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elong.net has a listing of the policies of the most common Chinese carriers&lt;/a&gt;. They're a reputable site for English language booking of transportation within China. The copyright notice at the bottom says 2010, so I don't know if the data is out of date. According to them, most of the carriers charge a 5% cancellation fee assuming you cancel well in advance and are flying a full class economy fare. Discounted fares have much steeper cancellation penalties. I have not vetted most of this information, but it matches my experiences with Air China and China Eastern. I also don't cancel flights much, so take that for what it's worth.
There are two considerations to this, which are &lt;em&gt;formally&lt;/em&gt; the issue. The &lt;em&gt;enforcement&lt;/em&gt; of them (if any) varies, depending on country you are from and country you are traveling to.

&lt;h2&gt;Hotel cancellation as proof of invalid application&lt;/h2&gt;

Schengen visa &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be revoked if you cancel the hotel booking, submitted with application. This had just made news recently here (Ukraine) by becoming a little more common for us lately.

The reason for it is primarily people using “easy” countries to get visa to get into “hard” countries. Canceling your hotel can be interpreted to indicate you never intended to travel to the country you applied for (regardless of it being Schengen visa).

The recommendation (as covered by news) is to &lt;strong&gt;email embassy about changes&lt;/strong&gt; like that in advance.

&lt;h2&gt;Hotel registering your stay with authorities&lt;/h2&gt;

I hadn't looked into it extensively, but to my knowledge plenty countries require visitors to register with authorities for anything but very short stay.

This is &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; handled by hotels, which is (in part?) why in some countries they require your passport presented for check in.

If you have alternate accommodations you might be legally obliged to &lt;strong&gt;report your stay yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.

I don't &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this is particularly strictly enforced, but it is also a consideration.
Recently my parents and I applied for a UK general visitor visa. My father's visa was rejected due to an influx of funds in his account. Furthermore, my mother’s application was also subsequently rejected as she was funded by my father for the trip. 

With regards to my application. I was funding my own trip and had a total of 13000 AED in my account (2380 GBP).I stated in my application that I had no other savings and that the trip would cost me 1000 GBP. 

Kindly note that I have previous lived in UK for 4 years as a student and left the country before my visa expired. 

Visa application feedback stated that: 

&lt;ol&gt;
I was using a significant portioning of my savings to fund the trip and this was considered unjustified. 
Secondly, since i am single and have no saving in UAE. It was considered probable that I might not return at the end of my trip. 
&lt;/ol&gt;

I have the following questions:

&lt;ol&gt;
When should I reapply? I am considering applying only for myself and my mother this time and funding her for the trip. 
What assurance can I provide to prove that I have a genuine reason to return to UAE at the end of my trip?
Is it possible that my visa was rejected because my parents visas were rejected? 
&lt;/ol&gt;
This is an Iranian website you can use for booking:

First of all its not about Finland which does not allow to have dual nationality . If you visit Migri pages, you can clearly find that they do not have any problem for Dual nationality . Its all from government of Pakistan who have contract with 16 other countries to keep dual nationality and if you get nationality of any other country except those 16 countries then you will have to legally surrender Pakistani nationality .I have worked out on this matter for the last one year , written several letters to government of Pakistan ,spoken to Finnish Embassy officials in Pakistan when they had their embassy in Islamabad.Finnish embassy(Islamabad) replied that they have no objection for that , its all from Government of Pakistan . 

I have also made a page on Facebook which is:&quot;We need dual nationality between Finland and Pakistan&quot; . Where it is clearly described that how government policy is discriminating Pakistanis living in Finland.Also this kind of laws are not for people living in UK,CANADA AND many other countries . 
If I am taking a cruise starting from Rome and covering only Schengen countries. Is single entry Schengen visa adequate for the trip
When flying, I normally take an empty water bottle (or two) with me. To comply with liquid regulations at security, I ditch any remaining water landside just before or after checkin, pass through security with completely empty water bottles (which is allowed), then find a water fountain air-side to refill it. I then have (for free!) water for the flight.

I can't see anything on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.londoncityairport.com/&quot;&gt;London City Airport website&lt;/a&gt;, either in text or on the map, about water fountains. I couldn't spot any either from a quick look in person, but I know that while London's Heathrow Airport has them they're not always the easiest to spot without directions, so it isn't impossible I missed them.

So, are there drinking water fountains air-side at London City Airport, and if so, where?
Having checked with both the information desk in the airport, and emailing the airport, the answer is sadly no. Their response was:


  Thank you for your comments about drinking water fountains.
  
  Lack of suitable locations has been the main issue why we have not
  introduced the facilities, however, we have started a terminal development
  program and are looking at making changes that best meets the passenger's
  needs. 


However, there is a workaround to get water for free:


  If you need water please approach any of our restaurants in
  departures and a member of staff will happily assist you.


I can confirm that the Caffe Nero near gates 21-24 have cups and a water jug out for all to avail themselves of, and the City Grill were perfectly happy to give me a glass of iced water (even offered a slice of lemon!) when I wasn't ordering anything else from them. I haven't tried asking to get a waterbottle filled though, will have to look into that on another trip.
As long as you stay within the Schengen area, you only need a single entry visa.

&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;

If I understand correctly, you want to go back and fourth between the UK and Schengen area? As many might have told you already the decision really depends on the embassy so no one can guarantee whether you will get a multiple entry visa or just single visa. This largely depends on your supporting documents. 

I can tell you from my past experience. I applied for a Schengen visa with French embassy for 5 days. I showed all the hotel booking and return tickets with enough money to cover the whole trip. But in the document I requested multiple entry for 6 months. I usually got it as I requested. I asked the embassy directly you can write in the form as many days as you want, maximum is 1 year. But the decision is still with the embassy.

You mentioned that you will be staying in the UK for 10 weeks that means your UK visa isn't valid more than 3 months so when you apply for Schengen visa you need to show your return ticket to your home country as well. They usually request that when they examine the documents at the embassy. 
If I attend a conference in Hong Kong, and stay in the Sheraton Hong Kong, does it have Western style bathroom facilities (seated), or Eastern (squat)?
A visitor to the UK wants to visit the sacred spring associated with Saint Chad (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwell_Heath&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Chadwell Heath&lt;/a&gt; -- Not the other ones in Mercia and Lichfield and Staffordshire) for its reputed healing and spiritual nourishment powers.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18532&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Megalithic&lt;/a&gt; for details.

The spring is on public land, but there are no public toilet facilities in the immediate area.  Where would the nearest public toilet facility be that someone could use?  Assume normal day time hours.  Night and bank holidays can be excluded, but something open on bank holidays would be gratefully received.

It seems like one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip. So I am planning to book a return ticket. For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this May. Myself &amp;amp; my friend are planning to travel.

I have a valid visa for Malaysia and I am going to Vizag on May22nd using another
itinerary and will return using below itinerary ( May 28th )


May 12th - Malaysia --&gt; Vizag  ( wont do journey )
May 28th - Vizag    --&gt; Malaysia ( will do journey)


My friend did not visit Malaysia yet, but if I booked below itinerary for him, could he do only the one way journey on May 28th ?


May 12th - Malaysia --&gt; Vizag  ( wont do journey because never visited before )
May 28th - Vizag    --&gt; Malaysia ( will do journey)

I know there are websites in Europe that search travel offers from all tour operators/agencie/etc and post the best offers on their website (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.holidaypirates.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;holidaypirates&lt;/a&gt; in the UK) 

Are there similar websites like that in Denmark or Sweden? 
No. If you don't show up for the outbound journey then your whole ticket will be cancelled. Among other reasons it is to stop people doing exactly what you want to do - buy a cheap&lt;em&gt;er&lt;/em&gt; return ticket and use one leg.
I have not stayed at the Sheraton specifically but based on my experience with other Hong Kong hotels/venues, I am pretty sure you will find “Western” bathrooms there.

But as far as (men's) toilet experience is concerned, in Hong Kong you must try The Peninsula, more specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1746041-r147194548-The_Bar_Peninsula-Hong_Kong.html&quot;&gt;its bar&lt;/a&gt; (you can go there even if you can't afford the hotel).
I have stayed at the Sheraton HK hotel (back in 2007), the one in Nathan road (that's the English name of the road if I remember correctly). The toilet is no different than any western style toilet. The hotel itself and its facilities are pretty decent.

I am a new parent looking to book a stay in Paris and am worried want a pleasant dining experience that does not endanger my 10 month old. Since the Madeleine McCann story I don't think it is reasonable to be leaving a child unattended in a hotel room and there is always the danger of a fire, which is not really resolved by having a video monitor.

So what I want is a hotel with a family friendly restaurant that opens a bit earlier, say about 5pm, so we can dine out together - without attracting looks from other diners who expect to dine in silence. 

Or is there another solution to this problem? How do you approach dinner time with a baby in a hotel?
I have raised three children and know the problem intimately.  This answer is about &lt;em&gt;bringing the baby&lt;/em&gt; along (you asked: &quot;&lt;em&gt;is there another solution to this problem?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;)

At the Northern end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_Mouffetard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rue Mouffetard&lt;/a&gt;, you'll find a covey of small restaurants, all of which provide a venue for comfortable, family-friendly restaurants.

These are very 'local' and reasonably priced (if anything at all in Paris is reasonably priced).

My last visit to the US was on Dec 17-2014 until Mar 14-2015 under the ESTA/VWP. I flew home in the Netherland after that. I plan to fly to Mexico on 15 May and want to stay there for a month, then get back to the US by motorcycle on 15 June. Would it be alright with the 90 days rule ?

I am an Indian student in the UK. If I already had a single entry Schengen visa and I apply again to the French embassy, will I be issued with multiple-entry?

If I get the visa, but due to a problem, I cannot travel on the intended dates(ones I mentioned on visa form) and decide to travel a month later, will it cause a problem when I travel next. And if I dont exactly follow the itenary that I submitted with my visa application?

As far as dates are concerned. I mean this: Suppose my visa is valid for May-August. When I applied for this visa, my itenary and hotel bookings were for June. But now I decide to travel instead in July. Will there be a problem if I did not take the journey for which I initially applied the visa and take a different journey later instead
About your question on whether it is “possible to search for dates when the cheapest fares apply”: SNCF offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://calendar.en.voyages-sncf.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;“best price calendar”&lt;/a&gt;. After you select stations and an approximate date of travel, you get a calendar with a price for each date, which is the price of the cheapest ticket still available on that date. Selecting a date shows you the train details for that day with the cheapest tickets highlighted.

The website b-europe.com offers a very similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.b-europe.com/Travel/Promotions/LowestFares/GeneralLFF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;fare calendar&lt;/a&gt;, which I wrote about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/45761/3387&quot;&gt;another answer&lt;/a&gt;. The SNCF calendar offers a wider range of station combinations though. For example, you can’t use the b-europe calendar for Paris—Amsterdam or Köln—Brussels, even though these are covered by direct Thalys connections. The SNCF calendar does support searches for these combinations. It may however not always show you all possible trains: the SNCF calendar shows TGV and ICE trains for Paris—Frankfurt, but it doesn’t seem to show the ICE trains that cover Köln-Brussels, only Thalys trains appear.

Thalys tickets can be bought up to three months in advance and the cheapest tickets are only offered for a limited  time. In my experience, if you don’t want to travel on a very early or very late train, you’d best book exactly three months in advance. You might want to check out the information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.b-europe.com/Travel/Promotions/Discounts/Thalys%201st%20Minutes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;“1st Minutes of Thalys”&lt;/a&gt; fare and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thalys.be.voyages-sncf.com/en/thalys-early-bird&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;“Thalys early bird fare”&lt;/a&gt;. For example, today (April 8th), sales started for tickets on July 8th; already some of the tickets for traveling from Paris to Amsterdam are labeled as “last remaining seats” (they mean “… at this price”):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FsUqY.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thalys Tickets Paris-Amsterdam July 8th&quot;&gt;

There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://thalys.be.voyages-sncf.com/en/thalys-last-minute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;“Thalys last minute fare”&lt;/a&gt; tickets as well, but these are more expensive than the early sales tickets and I’m not sure how likely it is you’re able to book one.
I'm a South African looking to go to the UK on a visitor visa for 6 months and will be staying with friends and family. On the visa page they say you need to prove you can support your self financially - I just wanted to know how much money I need and what if I have a family member that is going to support me financially on the trip, do they still need to put the money into my account or do I give their details when applying for the visa? 
As you can read at &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/26939/can-i-use-my-schengen-visa-for-a-completely-different-purpose-and-entry-point&quot;&gt;Can I use my Schengen visa for a completely different purpose and entry point?&lt;/a&gt; for example


  The visa is not specific to a country or purpose, it's valid for all short stays in the Schengen area. It's also perfectly fine to enter the Schengen area through another country


So another country fine, however this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/349170-schengen-visa-validity-question/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; warns you that the dates can not be changed -- if you intend to travel outside of the validity of your visa, you need to ask for a new one.

Edit: As long as your visa is valid while you are in the Schengen area you should have no problems. However, don't be surprised if you get a visa (single or multi entry doesn't matter) to the exact dates you provided for entry and leave. 
Can a US citizen born in America be denied a passport if that person lost more than 3 passports. If so, what should he do in order to obtain a passport?

I am planning a travel but now missplaced my passport. Tried to expedite, but they told me I have to wait for clearance, however with no bad intent but I am a very forgetful person. What should I do?
Are there any sensible ways to get from Dublin Airport to the Dublin Ferryport, without going via the city centre? Both are to the north of the city centre, so one might naively expect there to be an option. (That's no guarantee though!)

I've tried having a look on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dublinairport.com/gns/to-from-the-airport/by-bus-or-coach.aspx&quot;&gt;Dublin Airport website&lt;/a&gt;, but that didn't mention anything about the Ferry Port, just Dublin itself and other towns/cities in Ireland. Since the airport buses carry a premium, and a trip via the city centre involves two sets of traffic, it'd be ideal to avoid having to go Airport -&gt; City -&gt; Ferry Terminal, if sensibly possible.
Following on from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/45612/how-much-extra-time-to-allow-in-dublin-airport-for-us-pre-clearance&quot;&gt;earlier question on timings for US pre-clearance at Dublin airport&lt;/a&gt;, I've been watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/US-Preclearance.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;US pre-clearance at Dublin video&lt;/a&gt; from the Dublin airport website. That mentions that after checkin, passengers clear normal Irish security checks, then proceed (via optional shopping) to a TSA-style security check before reaching the CBP juxtaposed border control. It also mentions that duty free shopping is available after immigration and customs.

That leads me to wonder - can I buy duty free liquids in the main bit of Dublin Airport, before reaching the US pre-clearance area? Or must all duty free liquids (eg alcohol) be purchased in the smaller duty-free shop after US pre-clearance just before boarding?
If you have some plausible explanation for doing that, there is no reason postponing a trip for a few weeks should be an issue. Simply make sure you have all the documentation corresponding to your new itinerary (e.g. airline and accommodation bookings) with you when crossing the border. By contrast, going to the other end of the Schengen area without anything to justify the purpose of your trip &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be an issue, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/27672/can-i-travel-to-spain-using-a-greek-schengen-visa-even-if-i-dont-want-to-stay-i/27675#27675&quot;&gt;Can I travel to Spain using a Greek Schengen visa even if I don&amp;#39;t want to stay in Greece at all?&lt;/a&gt; and the other pages mentioned there for a full discussion of a range of scenarios.

But if you don't have the visa yet, it might not make sense to worry about this just yet. As a repeat applicant living in the UK, you do have reasonably good odds of gettting a multiple-entry visa but it's also possible you would still get another single-entry visa with a short validity period, based on the itinerary you submitted with your application and that wouldn't give you much flexibility.

Once you have made several trips to the Schengen area or if you are lucky enough to get a multiple-entry visa with a long validity this time, you will be able to change plans more easily.
I learned that if I'm carrying valuable goods in my checked baggage I should declare it to the airline, but I will have to pay for it.

How much should I expect to pay?

I'm traveling international with Qantas and carrying many electronic devices (video game consoles, tablets, cellphones) inside one of my baggage. It shouldn't be worth more than USD 1500 but this is much more they would pay in case the baggage is lost.
I am an Indian citizen residing in Canada for the last 4 months. If I carry two new handbags to India worth $300 approx, would I be required to pay import duty. I checked the website and it says that you can bring valuables worth Rs.35000 (approx. $600). I just want to make sure that new handbags won't be a problem.
People who try to gloss over a previous discrepancy often find themselves in an awkward situation as the 'tangled web' grows bigger and bigger.  They appreciate it more if you are straight up about it.

Your optimal strategy at this point is to identify the &lt;strong&gt;REAL&lt;/strong&gt; company you work for.  It may be different from what you wrote in your first application.  It also may not sound as impressive as the company you previously said you work for.

After you identify the &lt;em&gt;REAL&lt;/em&gt; company you work for, put their name down in question 5.2 of the application form. Then answer the remaining questions in Part 5 using your real company as the reference point.

You can then &lt;em&gt;optionally&lt;/em&gt; go to Part 9 of the form and explain that there is an interlocking relationship between Big Company and Little Company and you felt qualified to identify Big Company as the &lt;em&gt;employer of record&lt;/em&gt; but your recent experience with visa applications now leads you to think that Little Company is a more tenable fit.  

You do NOT have to go into a lot of detail about Big Company's &quot;справка&quot; being more impressive because they are not idiots and will know that already.  They will be happier to clear the air without having to read a long-winded (and contrived), not to mention transparently crap excuse.  Just a very brief, clean, blameless statement of clarification.

For your other question about how new the documents should be, there are no guidelines for visitor applications (unlike the very rigorous requirements for PBS applications) and every other Russian applicant solves the problem, otherwise we would never have visitors from Russia.  They already know how long it takes to get something translated, and if your documents are reasonably current there will be no problems in that domain.  Also, a one week visit looks out of whack.  Most people need about 2 to 4 weeks to have a proper visit.  Think about explaining that also.

Finally, you need to fix the provenance of funds issue they identified. It's an absolute, hands-down show-stopper and they will refuse again if you do not fix it.

Note:  Thank you for including the refusal formulae in your question!
You can't be denied a passport simply because you're forgetful, but you might be denied expedited processing. Somewhere, an officer is wondering what happened to all those passports you lost, and whether they might have been stolen or misused.

The reasons why one might be denied a US passport include:


&lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/news/picture-perfect-passport.html&quot;&gt;Submitting low quality passport photos&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/reasons-passport-would-denied-61703.html&quot;&gt;Failing to fill out the application completely&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/reasons-passport-would-denied-61703.html&quot;&gt;Failing to include payment&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/reasons-passport-would-denied-61703.html&quot;&gt;Failing to include legible and valid supporting documents&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/reasons-denial-us-passports-63314.html&quot;&gt;Not being a US citizen&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/legal-matters/child-support.html&quot;&gt;Owing more than $2500 in child support payments&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/can-still-us-passport-owe-irs-back-taxes-100657.html&quot;&gt;Owing back federal income taxes, in some cases&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/reasons-denial-us-passports-63314.html&quot;&gt;Having pending felony criminal charges&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/reasons-denial-us-passports-63314.html&quot;&gt;Being on probation or parole for a felony&lt;/a&gt;


If you had such a circumstance apply to you and your circumstances recently changed, it might not be possible to get expedited processing as the change in circumstances will need to be verified.

Further, if you have a history of lost/stolen passports, and you lose a passport while overseas, &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/lost-or-stolen-passports-abroad.html&quot;&gt;the embassy or consulate may issue a limited validity emergency passport&lt;/a&gt; which is only good for one year, rather than a full 10-year validity passport.

  If I carry two new handbags to India worth $300 approx, would I be required to pay import duty.
  
  I checked the website and it says that you can bring valuables worth Rs.35000 (approx. $600).


Is $300 more than $600?  I think you just answered your own question there.
If you buy items at the Dublin Airport duty-free, ask the staff to place your items in a sealed bag. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dublinairport.com/gns/shops-restaurants/eu-regulations-shopping.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;They should do this automatically for any liquid purchases.&lt;/a&gt; You will be allowed to take this bag through security, but it must remain sealed until you arrive at your destination.


  All liquid, gel and paste purchases will be placed in a clear plastic Travel Value bag and sealed at the point of purchase. The receipt must remain clearly visible. This bag must not be opened until final destination is reached. Opening or tampering with this sealed bag may result in confiscation at security check.


&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQj1p.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Duty Free sealed bag&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/conditions-carriage-full/global/en#jump7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; 7.4 Restrictions on Checked Baggage disown liability for damage to:  


  You must not include in your Checked Baggage:


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fragile, delicate or perishable items
computers
items with a special value, such as money, jewellery, precious metals, silverware
negotiable papers, share certificates, securities or other valuable documents
cameras
personal electronic equipment including compact discs
commercial goods or business documents, or passports and other travel documents.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


  If you carry items in contravention of these Conditions of Carriage, we will use all available defences against any claim in respect of any damage, loss or destruction of those items.


So I would be interested in what you learned where about valuable goods, since if you want them insured it may be that you take out the coverage rather than the airline.
This is common for many countries for visas, and the frustrating thing you realise is - there's no set amount of money.

Generally, you need to show you have 'enough' for the duration of your trip.  

So this might include a letter stating you've got accommodation sorted (staying with friends/family), plus money to show you can cover yourself.

What they're looking for is evidence that you've thought your trip through, including emergencies, contingencies and have worked out and have evidence of funds.

If you're being supported by a family member, you're still going to need evidence of the funds - otherwise they have no way of knowing if it's royalty or a broke cousin that's supporting you.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270197/sup-docs-settlement.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;From one such online British document detailing what to provide&lt;/a&gt;:


  If you are not funding your stay yourself, the person who will fund it
  should consider supplying the evidence


I suggest having a read of the document for further information as well, but essentially, the responsibility is on you to convince them that you're not going to end up in financial trouble while on your visa in the UK.  Frustrating :/
Irish Ferries operates a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/Ferry-Connections1/&quot;&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt; from Bus �ras. It's very infrequent but apparently it's in accordance with the ferry timetable.

Edit: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irishferries.com/Global/Offers/IF_bus_service_euro.pdf&quot;&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt; takes 15 minutes between Bus �ras and the Ferryport.

The 747 stops at Talbot Street, Talbot Place about 150m from the bus station. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/your-journey1/timetables/all-timetables/7471/&quot;&gt;timetable&lt;/a&gt; it takes 30 minutes. Obviously traffic can change this.
It depends on the hotel. Upscale ones, especially if they're western brands, will generally have western style (sit) toilets. Cheap hotels, especially if they're local or not a chain, will generally have eastern style (squat) toilets. It's easy to find your preferred style if you know where to look and can identify the clientele the hotel caters to. A large hotel might offer both styles, though I don't know of any that do.

For your specific case, the Sheraton has western style toilets, as you can see from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/photos/index.html?propertyID=482&amp;amp;mediaID=1028713781&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;photo #10 in the &quot;rooms&quot; gallery&lt;/a&gt; (in the center of the mirror, underneath the flowers, partially obscured by the sink's reflection):

I went on a three and a half month exchange to the UK Sept 2014 to DEc 2014. I've been back here at home in Canada since and now, in May 2015, will be going back to visit my boyfriend as a tourist for three months.

What documents should I bring along? Should I expect to be questioned?

I already plan to bring bank statements, proof of funds, a letter from my boyfriend stating I will be staying with him while I'm there, and proof of my return trip.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/North_Korea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;North Korean&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Sinuiju&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sinuiju&lt;/a&gt; has a ferris wheel, visible from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Dandong&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dandong&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nabcT.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sinuiju ferris wheel&quot;&gt;

What is its exact latitude/longitude?

I could not find it despite Google Maps being rather detailed in this area.&lt;br&gt;
The object at &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.11079,%20124.39409&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sll=40.11079,124.39409&amp;amp;sspn=0.014146,0.031629&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;40.11079, 124.39409&lt;/a&gt; can not be the ferris wheel as it lacks a central axis and does not have trees in front of it.      
You're only off by a couple hundred meters.

The problem is that the available satellite imagery is not very detailed, not sufficiently to make an object this small (when viewed from above) &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; visible. From above an object of this size is not quite as wide as a lorry, and perhaps as long. So, as we can see from the satellite image, which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; capture some lorries, this will be difficult to spot.

(I think the problem you had is that the ferris wheel is actually much smaller than you originally thought. A close up picture from the ground is below and makes this clear.)

Let us review what we know:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Never_moving_North_Korean_ferris_wheel.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The image you posted is also on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;; from its description we find out that it was taken from the end of the Broken Bridge. And one of the derelict bridge supports is visible in the picture. So the ferris wheel is between the bridge supports and the building with the blue roof.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://ssl.panoramio.com/photo/12943631&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Another picture&lt;/a&gt; puts it in perspective, and gives us more detail to work with.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrWC8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;断桥-原本通向朝鲜的部分 by ypspace; CC BY-NC-ND&quot;&gt;

Looking on the satellite image, down a line from where the bridge would have been, we spot the building with the blue roof to the right of the ferris wheel at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B006&amp;#39;38.9%22N+124%C2%B023&amp;#39;48.3%22E/@40.1108056,124.39675,448m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;40°06'38.9&quot;N 124°23'48.3&quot;E&lt;/a&gt;.

Secondly, we look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssl.panoramio.com/photo/98548353&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this picture of the ferris wheel and nearby carousels from the ground&lt;/a&gt;, (not inlined due to copyright) and match them up with the satellite view.

This places the ferris wheel at almost exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B006&amp;#39;42.0%22N+124%C2%B023&amp;#39;45.4%22E/@40.1116667,124.3959444,224m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;40°06'42.0&quot;N 124°23'45.4&quot;E&lt;/a&gt;. (While I don't think this is exactly centred on the ferris wheel, if you are standing at that spot you should be able to touch some part of it.)
I am applying for a B-2 visa and have the following questions:

1) I lost my expired passport on which I visited Dubai in 2011. Should I mention it in DS-160?

2) I am a government officer. I mention my salary and there is no option for other sources of income. Will I have to present those additional documents at the interview?

3)I am 28 years old and unmarried, going to visit New York and to see my younger brother who studies there. What are the chances of my visa application being approved?
In general, most restaurants in Paris will accept childs/babies with no particular issues, except maybe in the expensive ones. A good way to check the restaurant acceptance is to ask for a 'si�ge enfant' (child seat), many restaurants have one or two ready for customers. If you intend to keep your baby in it's trolley, just be careful not to disturb other customers or waiters movements. You should look for a restaurant where tables are not too close to each other.

Most restaurants in Paris will not be open for service at 5 PM, they usually begin around 7 PM. This means you will need to look either for 'brasseries' type (the kind depicted by Gayot Fow), or all day service restaurants, which restrict your choice, especially if you're looking for typical french meal. You will find a lot of asian shops where you can get hot meals about any moment in day.Also in touristic areas, you have more chances to find an all day service place, but that might not be the best bargain ....

I will therefore suggest that you go for a nice walk around your hotel (depending on it's location) and keep your eyes open to find a place that suits your need. Having your baby with you can sometimes be an opportunity for social exchanges ('how lovely ! how old is he/she ?').

Extras : if you have a feeding bottle or some prepared food for the baby, most restaurants will happily warm it for you in their kitchen. Although public breast feeding is commonly accepted in France, it is more subtle to feel whether a given place is fitted for it.
The Sheraton is above my discretionary accommodation level - but based on what is provided at less salubrious establishments, I'd expect western toilets in en suites and just maybe a squat toilet or too in shared facilities - usually well labelled on the door.

Even quite down-market Hong-Kong hotels are liable to have western-style toilets in en-suites.  As above, in shared wash-rooms with multiple toilets one or a few may be squat style. 

I use single 'room with ensuite in hostel' when possible (camera gear and PC safe, OK bed, air-conditioning, internet - what else do you need? :-) ) and these essentially always  have western style toilets.

Cross the border into Shenzhen and 'your mileage may vary', with upper level hotels offering flush toilets but lower price accommodation being more likely to provide only a squatty.
I have a toothbrush charger that is supposed to have a standard UK bathroom plug, but when I'm trying to plug it into the socket, it is very loose, and I'm not sure if it is charging as there is no indicator on the charger. See the images below. Is it the plug that is non-standard or is it the socket?

Note this is not a standard European plug - I have a EU extension cord so I checked. The span of the pins is too narrow. It is a BS4573 plug.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zL75D.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;socket&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/f86Hu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;plug&quot;&gt;
I have booked online, via Travel Up, a Turkish Airlines Economy Class flight from Manchester, England to Tbilisi, Georgia via Turkey with a layover in Istanbul.

The e-ticket states that the baggage allowance is 40kg. This seems a bit of an excessive (but welcome!) weight allowance for economy. 

I traveled last year with Turkish Air on the same route and the allowance was stated on the e-ticket as 30kg. I boarded with 28kg and had no problems.

I know all the conditions on the Turkish Airlines website says economy is 20kg, with various exceptions, but cannot understand why I have such a large allowance this time.

Does anyone know if this is correct and, if not, could I hold them to it at check-in as it clearly states 40kg on the e-ticket?
The BS4573 plug is a standard British shaver plug and the socket looks like a multi-plug receptacle. 

It could be that someone crammed something in the outlet that was too big and bent the contacts inside so they don't grip. Or maybe they are just getting well used and lost some of their spring.

You can try shining a flashlight into the socket to see if the contacts are visible or bent back.
I have an ESTA for my visit last Sept to NY and I know it is valid for 2years.  I am going to Las Vegas in May, do I have to update the address at which I will be staying?
I will be visiting the Versailles Chateau on a Tuesday. I was wondering if it would be useful to take a picnic with me since I doubt the fare offered inside the palace walls (if there is any) is not for vegetarians. Plus, &lt;strong&gt;I would like to picnic&lt;/strong&gt; there. What frightens me is the mention of &lt;a href=&quot;http://travelbeyondparis.com/palace-of-versailles-part-2-what-to-see-and-do-in-the-gardens-of-versailles/&quot;&gt;long queues at the baggage check&lt;/a&gt; (where presumably, I would need to deposit my picnic as I visit the interiors).

Alternatively, Google maps shows a couple of Boulangeries around the palace. Can I exit the palace and then re-enter after purchasing my food? I have a &quot;passport ticket&quot; to the palace allowing me to view the fountain show as well.

What the best option to ensure that I sustain myself on a day long trip (~8 hours possibly) to Versailles?
Of course you can picnic at Versailles, it's &lt;em&gt;de rigueur&lt;/em&gt;; in the gardens behind the palace that is (not inside).  You can picnic all year around whenever the gardens are open to the public.  In the summer the only problem is finding a suitable spot because the competition from other people having a picnic can be quite keen.  Pick your spot early and lay a blanket down to 'reserve' it as soon as you arrive in the morning.  Europeans will generally respect the 'reservation', especially the British and German tourists.


  On Bastille Day, the 14th of July, a wonderful &quot;D�jeuner sur l'Herbe&quot;
  is organized in the gardens of the Palace of Versailles. Thousands of
  people come together with their picnic baskets and have a festive meal
  on the banks of the Grand Canal. In English it is known as the Picnic
  of Versailles or the White Picnic (&quot;pique-nique en blanc&quot;), since
  white is the dress code.

  You need about one day to see Versailles gardens, but you will only
  see the essentials. And we tell you that from experience. The gardens
  of Versailles are incredible big and beautiful, a blend between nature
  and culture. You can have long walks, rent a boat, admire the
  sculptures and flowers, have picnics with friends, listen to the

For your last question: the best option is to eat a very large breakfast before you enter the grounds.  Don't drink too much wine at mid-day because it will slow you down and dull your senses.  The boulangeries in the surrounding neighbourhood are very upmarket; try to get your stuff in one of the arrondissments beforehand.
In my personal experience no. I've been to the US three times staying in different locations without altering the address. Although full disclosure, I'm not sure if that's ok, it is my personal experience.
No, you don't have to do so.

The official line, from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/frequently-asked-questions-about-visa-waiver-program-vwp-and-electronic-system-travel&quot;&gt;CBP FAQ page on the VWP and ESTA&lt;/a&gt;:


  &lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Can prospective travelers apply for an ESTA without specific travel
  plans if they want to be able to travel to the United States later on
  short notice?
  
  &lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Yes. VWP travelers are not required to have specific plans to travel
  to the United States before they apply for an ESTA. If a traveler’s
  destination in the United States is unknown when he or she completes
  the ESTA application, the traveler should enter “Unknown.” &lt;strong&gt;Travelers
  may update this information when their plans are finalized, but they
  will not be required to update their destination addresses or
  itineraries should they change after their ESTA application has been
  approved.&lt;/strong&gt; DHS recommends that ESTA applications be submitted as early
  as possible, as soon as, or even before travel is planned. ESTA will
  accept applications from last-minute and emergency travelers – those
  VWP travelers who arrive at the airport without an approved ESTA.

My partner and I are planning a long (2+ months) trip to China. The return date is unknown in advance. We may also want to visit other countries on our trip and ideally would prefer not to commit to returning directly from China.

We're considering whether to buy a 1-way plane ticket to Beijing (and buying the other way when we know from where and when) or an open-ended or cancel-able round-trip ticket.

Of these options - or others we haven't considered - which would be most practical in terms of:


Cost? Flexible tickets tend to be more expensive.
Visa requirements? We may need to present evidence that we actually plan to leave China.
Flexibility to change our plans. Are open tickets fixed to the departure airport? What about an open-jaw, open-date return flight?


This related question has general advice but I'm interested specifically in the visa requirements of China: &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1083/what-is-the-best-method-of-purchasing-a-ticket-with-an-open-return-date&quot;&gt;What is the best method of purchasing a ticket with an open return date?&lt;/a&gt;
If it matters, we're coming from Tel Aviv, Israel.
Of course it has. All mid to upscale Hotel in China do these days especially if they are name brand. Same for restaurants. The only &quot;hole in the ground&quot; style toilets I've seen in the last 5 years are either in very rural areas or inside the factory for operators and line workers.

Assuming you mean the Sheraton in Kowloon close to the harbor, it's really nice, if a bit dated, hotel. Haven't been there in a while but it used to have a great roof top pool with wonderful views of Victoria Harbor and Hong Kong proper. There also used to be a bar in the basement level that had beer taps build into the walls at the table with meters (like a gas station). When you sit down, they zero out the meter, bring you empty glasses and off you go (if you are into this sort of thing)
You have several possibilities for a picnic on a normal day (as &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/45835/22888&quot;&gt;Gayot Fow's answer&lt;/a&gt; mentions, the white picnic is worth the trip as well).

The first one is where everyone goes, particularly tourists - namely around the Grand Canal. I would not say that you need to &quot;reserve&quot; your spot but some places get crowded.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/lGJRP.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

A picture I took in May, on a Sunday, from the left bank of the canal, where the &lt;em&gt;All�e des Matelots&lt;/em&gt; meets the Grand Canal (showing the &quot;crowded areas&quot; above):

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bdit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

There is another place, where locals tend to picnic (more than tourists); This is also a typical place for children birthdays, starting from May

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0aPD0.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

I would not recommend any of the boulangeries - they are great for bread but will be horribly overpriced for a picnic. Better bring in stuff yourself, there are supermarkets nearby (the closest will probably be &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/LL5be&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Leader Price&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/QqF7H&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Super U&lt;/a&gt; which is not that far either). There are others too but I know that side of the gardens better :)

You can now drive into the Versailles Gardens ($$), which can be practical if you need to carry a picnic for 27 people.

&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; as promised

You have a few places where you need to pay in the Versailles castle:


the castle itself (with long waiting lines)
the gardens right in front of the castle (on the other side). You can access them either from the side of the castle, or from the other side (there are two ticket booths on the path from the Grand Canal to the gardens). BTW access if free during winter times.
the &lt;em&gt;Hameau de la Reine&lt;/em&gt;, a little village built for Marie-Antoinette, worth the walk.
the Trianons (small castles)


You probably can bundle some of these, I do not know because when I was actually &lt;em&gt;visiting&lt;/em&gt; Versailles all of this was free and now I walk or ride on the free part :)

A rough map of the pay vs free areas (I missed the Trianon in the pay area). The line in blue are the roads where you can drive.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h8g7G.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

If you had to make a hard choice I would go for the Hameau de la Reine which is unusual. Still, the castle is nice, the gardens are nice too. It really depends on the time you have.

You can also rent bikes at the entrances of the garden.

There are light and sound concerts in the evenings during spring, summmer and automn - I do not know if they are nice, at least the sound and the fireworks are OK (seen from the outside)

All in all Versailles is a fantastic city.
Even if flexible return tickets are more expensive, it could be cheaper than two One-Way tickets, due to the way how airlines calculate their OW fares. You could also try to get a good fare which is not completely restricted (e.g. changing the date for a fee like 100$), which could still be cheaper than flexible ones, even if you add the fee.
I am thinking about buying a smartphone while in Tokyo.

Do you have any physical store (I leave on Monday morning) to recommend?

I've already been to Yodobashi, where they showed me about 15 models.
( Yod&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;bashi, not Yod&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;bashi )

Yodobashi would be my first choice, unless you want an iPhone. Bic is more-or-less the same as Yodobashi, just the music is more annoying.

If you know which model you want, Amazon.co.jp is another good choice.

Do check that it explicitly says &quot;unlocked&quot; on the box. The Japanese mobile carriers generally do everything possible to keep you from taking your money elsewhere.

The reason I said &quot;unless you want an iPhone&quot; is service. Android phones are cheap enough that if it breaks after you leave Japan it's not worth fixing. iPhones start at US$600. Get them from the Apple online store, which also gets you worldwide warranty service.

Neither Bic nor Yodobashi want to see you again if you have problems with your purchase.
As you already figured, the baggage information on Turkish Airlines states a basic 20kg per passenger for international flights, with a lot of exceptions.

Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-uk/travel-information/baggage/free-baggage-allowance&quot;&gt;baggage information page&lt;/a&gt;, I can see exceptions for flights from/to USA and Canada, South America, many African countries and some European countries like Germany and Ireland. There are even exceptions based on the season. There is however no exception for UK. But the most important part of the page is maybe the message at the very top:


  The free cabin and checked baggage allowance may vary according to reservation class and departure runway. Please check your ticket for information regarding your free baggage right.
  For interline flights, the baggage policy of the airline designated Most Significant Carrier by the system will be in effect.


So what matters is not so much the (complex) content of that page, but the ticket. You should read your ticket (if you received multiple emails from your travel agent, this is usually written at the beginning of the email if it is or not a ticket) and only this condition applies.

Also, even though Turkish Airlines is most likely operating both of your flight segments, there is also the rule of the Most Significant Carrier. This means what applies is the allowance of the airline operating your longest/most significant segment:


  If another airline is involved in your whole journey; the most significant carrier’s (MSC) free baggage allowance rule will be applied. MSC is assigned according to which airline operates the most significant and/or longest part of the journey. 


On the baggage page of Turkish Airlines, there is also a distinction between some cases giving you 40kg of allowance or 2 pieces of 20kg. So if this is the case, you may bring one bag of 40kg. However, as @AndrewFerrier commented, most airlines usually forbid bags over 32kg, most likely to respect the back of airport workers. This is actually probably a request from airports. So, for their health, and to avoid paying overweight fees, it is probably better to bring bags weighing less than 32kg.

So in the end, you should look at your ticket to know your baggage allowance.
Generally speaking, you will need to have proof of onward travel within the time limit set by your visa to enter China. Airlines are preferred, though I personally have never had issues at the overland Hong Kong crossings without proof of onward travel. But on the flip side, I know people who have, and where you enter the country makes a difference in this respect. If you buy a one way ticket but try to enter as a tourist (or on any other sort of limited stay visa), there's a good chance of being refused, including at your home airport when departing. You don't want to be in that position.

An open jaw ticket is more expensive than a planned round trip, but you're paying for the flexibility. You could consider booking a round trip ticket with a very late return date, and opting to pay the alteration fee to shift to an earlier date when you want to leave. You ought to also be able to change the departure city in this case (again, for a fee). Whether or not this is cheaper than an open jaw depends on your specific plans and how far in advance you make them. If you decide that you want to leave China the next day, then almost certainly the open jaw would have been the cheaper option. But deciding a month in advance, probably not.

It's worth noting that several of the major Chinese airlines will consider your ticket valid for one year. That's not to say that changing its dates will be free, but if you've bought a pricier fare and do it at least several days in advance, it might be. &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/45771/26735&quot;&gt;My answer on another question about Chinese airlines' cancellation policies&lt;/a&gt; is relevant, as many of them use the same policy for cancellation and alteration.

I doubt this is feasible, since you mention flying to Beijing, but for completeness' sake: if possible, I recommend using Hong Kong as your destination airport and traveling overland to China (or perhaps Taiwan and taking the ferry). You'll incur a few hours' travel time (2-3 from HKG to Shenzhen) and the price of transit (should be under 10 USD, assuming you take the metro) but the airfares using HKG instead of SZX or CAN are considerably cheaper in my experience. Overland travel is also much cheaper and generally more flexible than airfares.

  Non-EU citizens in possession of a National Visa (NV) for sojourns longer than 90 days are required, within eight (8) days from entry into Italy to request a residence permit (permesso di soggiorno) from the Italian authorities, and will be subject to photo/fingerprint registration.

Which is the reason that there is so much difference in the price of bottled mineral water between European countries? For example in Greece a 0,5 lt bottle costs 0.5 euro but in e.g Italy, Germany or UK the same quantity is about five times higher. After all water is very important and crucial and in the majority of the countries access to public tap water is limited.
I am not aware of such difference in price for bottled water. I haven't been in Greece yet, but in most European countries I bought bottles of water for less then 50 ct per liter. That is in local supermarkets.

Could it be that you are comparing prices in bars and restaurants? Usually tap water is of high quality. In France for example, you can order still water or sparkling water in which case you pay between 2 and 4 euro. You could also ask for a carafe of water which usually is free of charge.

In most cases people just pay for the brand or because they consider it more appropriate for their social class.

So if there is a price difference it boils down to demand and availability. If most people drink tap water, only the upperclass drinks bottled water, who can afford high prices. Also with less people drinking bottled water, less quantities are needed, increasing the cost for transportation 
The answer is: The price is actually not that different. I travelled most of the European countries and mostly lived from food and drinks bought in local supermarkets. If you know where to buy, water isn't expensive in any european country. For example, in Germany you get a 0,5 l bottle of water for less than 15 cents (plus deposit of 25 cents). Actually, you won't find cheaper water in Spain, Italy, France, Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium etc. - but maybe in eastern europe. However, even in very expensive countries like Switzerland, Norway or Iceland you won't have to pay more than 50 cents per litre. But note that the latter three countries don't have Euro, but their own currency and a more decoupled economy which explains the difference.

So why do you think, the price is so different?
Savings are a factor but the major factor is a steady income in your place of residence that assures your return to your country of residence. Not having a source of income would seriously hamper your chances of getting a visa. Having immovable properties and investments are also a big plus when applying for a visa. They do not look at the total amount you have in your bank account, they are more concerned with where and how the money is coming from.

Having returned within the visa time frame as a student is not a guarantee that you would get a visitors visa.

You should apply when you have a source of income and a reasonable amount of money in your savings/investments. Having GBP3000-4000 in total savings makes it look a bit odd.
I recently did something similar, and that included some Asian countries, including China. First hand experience:

&lt;strong&gt;Flexible tickets tend to be much more expensive than a round trip fixed fare.&lt;/strong&gt; 

I'm not sure which Airline you are flying, but Turkish Airlines, Kuwait Airlines, and Emirates are likely. All three Airliners have these flexible option, but in my opinion, flexible tickets are unreasonably expensive. Do a search and see if two round tickets are cheaper than the round trip. 

&lt;strong&gt;If you plan to fly budget airlines in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, or Vietnam&lt;/strong&gt;

Don't forget to check Air Asia. They have many code names (AK, D7, etc), but overall, Air Asia is a wonderful budget Airline. Return tickets are priced same as two separate tickets (excet you'll have to pay for credit card processing). This wouldn't apply to countries that you can't manage to fly budget airlines for the entire trip. 

&lt;strong&gt;Changing the flight &lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt; will require you to pay the pay difference anyway&lt;/strong&gt;
In most cases, when you change the flight date, if the new dates rate is higher than what you paid for, you will have to pay for the date change &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the fare difference. This is practically more expensive than buying two tickets. Flexible tickets should be fine though. 

&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Open Jaw tickets !?!?&lt;/strong&gt;

Open Jaw tickets are expensive. Flexible tickets are expensive too. Flexible Open Jaw tickets are going to cost you even more. 

I would suggest that you just purchase a ticket from origin to Beijing, and your very next trip first. I have never been asked to show a return flight ticket while entering China (We have to get visa in advance though), and I have never seen anyone being questioned. If you can convince that you really plan to leave the country and you have no strict plans, you should be fine though. This outwards ticket doesn't have to be a return flight to back home -- just a ticket to get out of the country. 

&lt;strong&gt;You will probably don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go back to China either.&lt;/strong&gt;

Beijing, Shang-hai, Xi'an, and these cities are huge cities, but a 2 month trip means you'll be overwhelmed with China. Language barrier, weather, smog, and such things are exciting at first, but in my own experience, I'm done with China for a few years :)


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cost? Flexible tickets tend to be more expensive.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  Do your own research first. But I believe separate segmented tickets would give you the best flexibility vs price combination. 
  Since you mentioned visiting other countries, China has an excellent network with Hong Kong (administration area), Taiwan, and Russia. For other countries, flying will save you money and time (From China, you can even enter India from the West Bengal region. But arranging transportation and getting used to India from there would be too difficult). 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Visa requirements? We may need to present evidence that we actually plan to leave China.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  Probably. If you plan to visit Taiwan or some neighboring country, you should be fine. Unused visa stamps for other countries work very well too. 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Flexibility to change our plans. Are open tickets fixed to the departure airport? What about an open-jaw, open-date return flight?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


I haven't really had a chance to book a flight or even see this open to book a ticket that origin of the return flight is flexible. This will definitely add up some extra charges if the Airline has to use some less-than-popular routes for you. If this actually worked, I'd consider myself very lucky. 

Don't worry about the return dates first. I once spent a lot of money on return flights, skipped a few return flights, and even booked another flight ticket because I was lazy to take the train. Carry some extra cash, and do not be too quick to spend money on a ticket. If you have a valid visa, wait a little more and you'll find some perfect deals. Flexibility costs money, but if you manage the little details, you should be fine.

Enjoy your trip.
If you lost a passport then answer yes. I do not quite see how this can be a question. Are you asking whether you should lie on the DS-160???? Of course not! The two fundamental rules of dealing with immigration officers: 1) never lie 2) never offer information unasked. BTW at the interview they will want to see the previous passports.

I do not get this question. What additional documents? You have documents showing other sources of income, like a rental? In that case, you are running a (one person) business and so


  If you are a business owner, enter an average amount of net income you receive from the business after expenses.


So I would enter the total amount you are getting a month from every source that you can back up with paperwork.

As a Canadian citizen you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa/y/canada/tourism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;don't need a visa&lt;/a&gt; to come to the UK, however, the same site recommends you to bring the same documents you would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/343241/2014_08_Visitor_Documents.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;if you apply for a visa&lt;/a&gt;:


Letter of employment (if you have one)
Proof of funds (Bank statements, tax returns)


As far as being questioned this is actually at the discretion of the border control officers so the best answer is: depends on quite a fiew things.
I have flown from UK (London) to Tbilisi with Turkish Airlines many times. I have my next flight from London to Tbilisi booked for just over a month from now. The baggage allowance normally is 20 kg and this is stated on the ticket.

What you can do is go to the Turkish Airlines website and then find your reservation there - even if you didn't buy the ticket directly from them, you can access it using your details.

If you have your e-ticket number, you can go directly to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www4.thy.com/mybookings/etinput.tk?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www4.thy.com/mybookings/etinput.tk?lang=en&lt;/a&gt; and input your ticket number and name and access the details.  If not, you can go into My Bookings section and use your PNR and name.  Then from there navigate to &quot;View my e-ticket&quot; - there, you'll see your baggage allowance.

The image below is a screenshot from my booking for later this year - you can see it showing 20 kg for each leg.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/D3wJR.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;

Note that if you are travelling with a child, then the allowance shown on the e-ticket will be the combined one for you and the child - as can be seen on this second screenshot for another flight of mine booked for later this year.  Here the allowance shown is 40 kg - 20 kg for myself and another 20 kg for a child occupying a seat.  If it were an infant without a seat, then it would show 30 kg (I had this last year).

I am currently in UK on ICT Tier 2 VISA for 6 months. My wife (housewife) applied for general visit Visa in March 2015, to join me and for tourism purpose for 4 months. She intended to leave Uk with me in July 2015.

But her visa was rejected, here is the exact reason stated: &quot;&lt;em&gt;You intend to travel to UK to join your husband. You have provided no information regarding thee purpose of your proposed visit other than to join him. I note that your husband has applied for VISA for duration of 6 months. I note that you are supported by your husband in India&quot;
&quot;There is a category of visa that allows a spouse to join a migrant whoo has tier 2 employment visa. I am not satisfied that you are merely joining you husband as dependant.&quot;
&quot;As you have provided no information regarding thee purpose of your proposed visit other than joining your husband, I do not consider you are travelling to Uk for tourism purpose. I am not satisfied that you will leave UK at the end of the proposed visit&lt;/em&gt;&quot; 

I note that, she had not provided any air tickets for her travel; neither she had submitted travel itineary. We were planning to book the air tickets after VISA arrival. I guess the Visa application was for general visit, but somehow represented as dependant visa.

Can anyone please tell me, what we missed here and can she apply again immediately? Is this a big issue? Or She can get visa again if she corrects the missing things? Do we have to plan and book the hotels in advance and show the hotel bookings as travel plan? Its really difficult to plan and book hotels for holidays in future. 

Please help with your suggestions and inputs if any. Thanks for your help.        
I'm in Michigan and I'd like to get to Tennessee or Florida. My idea is to go by car but when I see what the rentals cost (one way is immensely more expensive and I won't be going back north myself), It feels kind of pricey.

Is there a cheaper option? I've googled to see if I can find a web site with one way cars (someone who wants his delivered, for instance) but haven't been lucky with that.

Suggestions?
There are Drive Away services that match drivers with vehicles that need to be driven to a specified destination.  A quick web search for &quot;drive away services&quot; will turn up number of these companies.  These services usually don't charge rental fees, you just fill up the gas as you go.  Most do require some sort of security, such as a cash deposit or credit card authorization hold.

BUT most of these deals have time restrictions, ie you have XX days to get the car/van/RV from point A to point B.  As such they might not be suited for your needs if you plan to stop and explore as you go.

We'll be traveling to the Pantanal in July this year. We'll start our trip in Cuiaba and will be traveling along the Transpantaneira. I think that at this time it will be the dry season.&lt;br&gt;
I found conflictive information about the weather, so I'm not sure what to wear. Especially during the nights, since we'll have some night walks there. I read that it will be around 10� Celsius cold, which I find (here in Germany) very freezing. 

So - what should I take with me? Right now I have a light rain coat or cardigan, long trousers, shirts and low hiking boots. At night I thought it would be enough to change from cardigan to sweater... but now I'm not so sure anymore :)

Do you have any more tips for the clothing? Like - it has to be a light color, ...
While Jonas' answer is indeed the legal situation but note: there is no penalty for breaking this particular law and more importantly, no US citizen can be denied entry to the USA if said person can prove citizenship. This is more generic than the USA, this is one of the fundamental meanings of citizenship. A birth certificate is a good start, the more IDs you have, the better. Expect a long, painful process border crossing if you do it without a passport.

It's a whole another topic whether an airline would let you board on the grounds of &quot;Oh, I will convince the border guards, no worries&quot;. You might need to fly to Toronto or Vancouver and get across on land. If you don't drive, then the easiest is probably the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/transitwindsor/routes-and-schedules/tunnel-bus-to-detroit/pages/tunnel-bus-to-detroit.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Windsor Tunnel Bus to Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. From Toronto, there's a VIA Rail three times a day to Windsor. There are no similar services in Vancouver, you'd need to walk a lot. Note this bolded note on the Tunnel Bus page:


  Proof of citizenship is required when crossing the international Windsor-Detroit border. 


Every other border crossing carrier I am aware of, BoltBus, Greyhound, Amtrak, Quickshuttle all wants a passport. Let's see &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/45874/crossing-from-to-canada-to-the-usa-w-o-passport-on-public-transit&quot;&gt;Crossing from to Canada to the USA w/o passport on public transit?&lt;/a&gt; what else is possible.
As we know, US citizens can cross into the USA w/o a passport if they can prove citizenship. I am just curious, what if you don't drive? Starting from Toronto, I can see trains both to Windsor and Niagara Falls. From Windsor, you can take the Tunnel Bus across (and curiously enough, it emphasizes only proof of citizenship is necessary). From Niagara Falls, you can walk across the Rainbow Bridge. Once across, you can get to DTW or from Niagara Falls, BUF or IAG.

From Vancouver, based on my own experience, Amtrak, Greyhound, BoltBus, QuickShuttle all wants to see a passport before letting you on (edit: Quickshuttle let me board last month both directions without asking for passport!). You can't get really close to either of the US border crossings with Translink (it's a mile from 8th Av) and if you do walk over, there isn't a lot of public transit from the other side to BLI or SEA either.

So, what solutions exist if you are in a situation &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13867/can-i-cross-the-usa-canada-border-with-a-birth-certificate-and-a-passport-locato/45873#45873&quot;&gt;Can I cross the USA-Canada border with a birth certificate and a passport locator number?&lt;/a&gt; like this and you don't drive and want to get from a Canadian airport to a USA airport?
I finally have the answer.

I called up Turkish Airlines and they have confirmed that my checked allowance is 40kg, although this must be divided over two suitcases as the limit is 32kg per case.

Thank you everyone for your research and advice. It looks like I'll have to order a bigger taxi to the airport!
If you only want to buy a one-way ticket to China and worry about getting the other one-way ticket when you want to leave, buy both tickets now, but have the return trip be refundable. Then, when you get to China, you can show proof of onward travel at immigration, and then later at your hotel/hostel/wherever, you can just cancel it. Then you can buy a flight you actually want closer to your departure date.
I have applied for the UK dependent visa my wife has a European passport and I have Indian passport.

We have given all documents and today is 8th day and the UK visa centre has sent me an e-mail saying that the uk visa application has been processed and a decision has been made. your passport and documents will be dispatched via VFS. 

What does it mean?  Is it that my visa has been granted?
It likely means just that 'your passport and documents will be dispatched'.  It's  a stock email that gets produced automatically when they're finished processing, and rather than have to customise it for each person with results, it's just to let you know your documents are on their way back.

Unfortunately, this means you'll likely have to wait for your documents/passport to arrive in the mail before you know the outcome of the decision :/

Airlines will not let you board without the proper documentation, ie: passport, period, end of story. The reason being is that public carriers can get fined if you are not eligible to enter the USA and they transport you there.

Trains and buses are also public carriers and are supposed to document that you have permission to cross the border before boarding you.

The &quot;I am a US citizen and you can't keep me out&quot; line does not work for anyone except a US CBP agent. So basically you need to speak with a CBP agent and without a car you would have to walk to the check point and start explaining. But even they can make your life miserable and send you packing to the nearest Embassy or consulate to arrange a replacement passport before being allowed to enter, if they so decide.

Sneaking across the border or even being outside the country without your passport in the first place ... well as Forest would say &quot;stupid is as stupid does&quot;.
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Palace of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;, or simply Versailles, is a royal ch�teau in Versailles in the Ile-de-France region of France.

The Palace of Versailles, or simply Versailles, is a royal ch�teau in Versailles in the Ile-de-France region of France. In French, it is known as the Ch�teau de Versailles." Body="My friends and I are planning a cycling trip for this summer. We usually do this once a year and often go to the Alps (Austria/France/Switzerland/Italy) but this time we would like to go somewhere else. We're now looking into Romania / Poland.

What we usually do is ride somewhere by car, find a camping ground and than make cycle trips from there on race bikes (so with no luggage). What I am wondering, with no intention of judging or whatsoever, is how safe it is to go around cycling in these parts of the world. I am not so much concerned about the traffic (Can't be more dangerous than Italy, right? ;) ) but how are the chances of robbery when you're going around with 4/5 expensive bikes and equipment?

On camping grounds we usually lock the bikes with a ludicrous amount of locks, but out on the road you can get to some pretty remote locations.
I am planning to go to the UK with my brother. I've been to the UK two times last year, but my brother is a freshy and this will be his first foreign trip. We want to travel to Paris during our visit to the UK. What advice is there to minimize the chances of problems in obtaining these visas. We are holding Indian passports and our financial condition is strong.
I'm a citizen of Brazil and Australia. My Brazilian passport is expired and I'm unable to renew it quickly due to not being up-to-date with my voting obligations. 

The procedure to normalise my voting status and renew the Brazilian passport will take a while, but I need to travel urgently to Brazil. Therefore, obtaining a visa on my Australian passport would be a quicker option.

Is there any issue of me requesting a visa and entering Brazil on a foreign passport despite being a citizen?
Difficult to give an answer with hard data on this question, but I can talk from personal experience of cycling multiple Eastern European countries (not Romania, but Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, Kosovo...)

Traffic, especially out of the cities, is in general pleasant. This is mainly because the traffic is less dense in Eastern Europe, than in Western Europe. But people tend to drive fast on curvy roads. Just make sure you stick to the right side of the road and everything should be fine. To me it didn't feel less safe than Italy, but even in Italy there is a huge variation. I felt a lot safer in the Alps than in let's say Napoli.

Considering the risk of robbery, you are in my opinion overly worried. It can of course happen, just like it can happen anywhere. But normally the remote places are the safest in that regard, while it are the cities that pose the highest risk for criminality.

My advice would be to tackle the safety aspect in exactly the same way as you did it on previous trips and focus on more important issues: finding nice routes etc.
Just to complete the answers:


  Can I exit the palace and then re-enter after purchasing my food?


&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, at least it was not possible when I last went there (September 2014).

The reason is most likely because it is not possible to verify that the same person who is leaving is the person coming back. Tickets are not registered to a given name (otherwise, checking all of them would take inordinate amounts of time). Therefore, you would be able to visit the château in the morning, leave it, and then re-sell/give your used ticket to another person. To avoid that, they disallow re-entering using the same ticket.

Conclusion: unless you are exempt (i.e. EU residents &amp;lt; 25 years old) and willing to re-queue, you cannot leave to buy food.

BTW, the food indoors is quite expensive: sandwiches were about 8€ IIRC. There's also a restaurant indoors, but I dared not check the prices.
Speaking of Poland, where I live, I'd say there's nothing to worry about regarding safety. No wild tribes living in the forests, no pirates and no horse stealers gangs are there nowadays :) Of course if you leave your expensive bike outside without any lock, it can happen that someone will pay more interest to it and eventually take it, but I'm sure it's equally possible in Italy or the Netherlands. But reasonable amount of precaution similar to wester Europe will be more than enough to spend fantastic time here.
You could book a tour taking you around certain places in Tehran. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uppersia.com/Iran-day-tours/tehran-tours.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; there are tour options from 4 to 6 hours, and I assume there'd be many agencies willing to arrange group tours in case you have specific needs or preferences.
Manuel, apparently there's a document called &lt;strong&gt;ARB&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Autoriza��o de Retorno ao Brasil&lt;/em&gt; (&quot;Authorization to Return to Brazil&quot;). I first found it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoriza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Retorno_ao_Brasil&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, then I found it on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cglondres.itamaraty.gov.br/pt-br/arb_autorizacao_de_retorno_ao_brasil.xml&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;brazilian consulate in London website&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, I could not find any link on that subject in a website from brazilian consulate or embassy in Australia.

In short, &lt;em&gt;ARB&lt;/em&gt; it is a document valid for a single trip back to Brazil. Once in the country, it will be seized by the authorities and you'll need to renew your Brazilian passport before leaving the country (or use your Australian one).

I'm sure you can call your nearest consulate in Australia and obtain this document that will allow you to come back to Brazil.
&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Looks like an ARB can be processed in 3 days, while &lt;a href=&quot;http://camberra.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/tourist_visa.xml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a tourist visa can take up to 15&lt;/a&gt;, so this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the way to go after all.  Leaving this here for posterity though, since it's still the general answer to most &quot;can I enter with the wrong passport&quot; questions.

&lt;hr&gt;

I can't find any definitive source on whether you're technically required to enter Brazil on a Brazilian passport if you have one, the Brazilian embassy to Australia merely says you are &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://camberra.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/tourist_visa.xml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to use it.  Nonetheless, the practical thing would be to &lt;strong&gt;apply for the visa for your Australian passport&lt;/strong&gt;, and use that to travel to and from Brazil.  Three things can happen:

&lt;ol&gt;
The visa application is refused because they realize you're Brazilian.  Fine, you're still in Australia, follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/45893/1893&quot;&gt;gmauch's advice&lt;/a&gt; and apply for the ARB temporary passport instead.
Your visa is granted, you fly to Brazil, and at the border they realize you're a Brazilian citizen.  But you're already there and a citizen, so they can't deny you entry &amp;mdash; welcome to Brazil!
Your visa is granted, you fly to Brazil, you enter as as Australian.  Problem solved, and this is by far the most likely scenario.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: In scenario 2, if using a foreign passport to enter Brazil turns out to be illegal, there's a chance that getting busted will involve getting held at the border for a while, fines or other unpleasantness.  You could do worse than ask the embassy, foreign ministry or other reliable source for advice, although it may be difficult to get a straight answer out of them.

If you're unwilling to risk this, there's option 2B: get the visa, fly to Brazil as an Australian (so the airline lets you on board), but at the border, show them your expired Brazilian passport.  This is perfectly legal, and they'll let you in eventually, although you may be in for a long wait while they figure out what happened and how you got here.  And you'll now need to get a Brazilian passport before you can leave... unless you exploit the Mercosur loophole to leave Brazil with Brazilian ID, enter a neighboring country as Australian, and fly out from there.

&lt;h2&gt;Pantanal Temperature Excursion&lt;/h2&gt;

You are right in saying that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pantanal.org/pantdesc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;July falls in the Pantanal dry season&lt;/a&gt;:


  the Pantanal has two seasons: a wet season from roughly October to March, and a dry season from April to September.


Nevertheless you should keep in mind that dry does not necessary mean warm. Indeed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brazil.org.za/pantanal.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;there are various websites warning that nights in the Pantanal can be quite colder than during the day&lt;/a&gt;:


  Even during warmer seasons, the nights in the Pantanal can become crisp and cold. Therefore, tourists are urged to bring some warm clothing, regardless of when they are visiting.


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Pantanal-weather-averages/Parana/BR.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The World Weather Online page on weather in the Pantanal&lt;/a&gt; shows that July is the coldest month, as both maximum and minimum temperatures graphs are at their minimums:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZWnI.png&quot; alt=&quot;The World Weather Online page on weather in the Pantanal&quot;&gt;

This is also backed up by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pantanalescapes.com/about/climate.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the Pantanal Escapes webpage on climate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-central-west/the-pantanal/weather&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the Lonely Planet webpage on the topic&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the temperature difference between the two sites might be due to a number of factors, including sampling years and location (it will be colder in the middle of the Pantanal, as opposed to the rural settlements).

This is all to say that you should consider a temperature excursion &amp;Delta;T &amp;simeq; 10&amp;deg;C  when packing clothes for a trip to the Pantanal.

&lt;h2&gt;What to Pack&lt;/h2&gt;

When it comes to what to pack for cold weather, the answer is simply: warm clothes. Of course only you can judge how cold you might be, since this is very subjective. In my opinion though it is always better to overestimate the cold than it is to underestimate. If your jacket is too warm you can always take it off. On the other hand you'll definitely be cold if you have nothing warmer to wear. If you want to reduce your pack weight you can always invest in tactical lightweight gear. To this purpose, light polar fleeces are a very wise investment in my opinion.

A number of discussions on the topic exist online. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294280-i1045-k6442158-What_to_wear_in_the_Pantanal_in_the_evenings-Brazil.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this post on the Tripadvisor&lt;/a&gt; forum explicitly mentions bringing warm clothing when visiting the Pantanal in July:


  the evenings gets actually quite cold by Brazilian standards. I was there last year July (which is officially winter time) and misjudged myself how cold it actually was. If you go on the river on a cloudy day, it gets really cold also - wind chill and so on. So take at least one fairly warm jacket, like a windbreaker or polar fleece.


For a more general list of suggestions based on hands-on experience, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/South_America/Brazil/Estado_de_Mato_Grosso/Pantanal-1508753/Packing_Lists-Pantanal-TG-C-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;see this virtual tourist discussion on the topic&lt;/a&gt;.
As a South-African citizen, I have received a valid 30-day tourist visa for Dubai, UAE. At the end of my vacation, I will be traveling on to the Seychelles for a few days, before returning home. My return flight has me arriving in Dubai with a one night layover before my final flight the next day back to South-Africa.  

Do I need to get a second visa for the one night I'll be spending in Dubai on the return flight's layover?
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Pantanal&lt;/a&gt; is a natural region encompassing the world's largest tropical wetland area. It is located mostly within the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, but it extends into Mato Grosso and portions of Bolivia and Paraguay. It sprawls over an area estimated at between 140,000 and 195,000 square kilometres (54,000 and 75,000 sq mi).

Roughly 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing an astonishing biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping to support a dense array of animal species.

For more information, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pantanalescapes.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;see the Pantanal Escapes website containing plenty of information on the Pantanal&lt;/a&gt;.

Body="As @MatthewHerbs indicates, there are taxi companies that will take you from the Blaine crossing to the Bellingham airport and probably as far as SeaTac too for quite a price: about $50 to BLI, about $250 more to SEA.

Much to my surprise, it seems this is it: Toronto or Vancouver and that's it.

The main Canadian airports are:


Calgary International Airport
Edmonton International Airport
Halifax Stanfield International Airport
Montr�al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport
Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport
Toronto Pearson International Airport
Vancouver International Airport
Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport


For Calgary (actually, Medicine Hat is an airport closer to the border), Winnipeg,  Montreal and Ottawa there is practically nothing south of these cities in Canada neither across the border so there's no public transit. Compare the population density of northern Montana / North Dakota / the Adirondacks to the Windsor / Detroit area. Edmonton and Halifax are far from the border.
With the recent regulations concerning electronic devices having to be charged, to take them on the plane, I'm wondering, do you also have to do this with electronics bought airside at the airport, which would presumably have very little charge when taken out of the box for the first time?
Or do they get wrapped in a special bag like liquids do?
I took the Tunnel Bus.  The driver did not ask any identification.  I suppose that with such a local bus running back and forth all the time, it is easy for them to take people back if they are denied entry.

So, with the Tunnel Bus you need to convince only the border security.
I live in Thailand and hold a B1/B2 visa to the US. If I wish to visit Canada or some other place can i enter Canada or other place with my B1.B2 US visa?
To be honest unless you are arriving here by plane then no, there is no good duty free. But alcohol is cheap enough, you can buy at tescos, lidl, aldi etc. Although the large tescos superstores carry the best range at a good price.

For boarding a plane you would only be allowed the standard 100ml bottles in carry on and would have to check the rest.

More importantly you might want to check what is the regulation in your destination country for import; for instance, absinthe, popular in CZ, is illegal in the US and Canada for importation. 
The best in Prague is exchange.cz for exchange rates hands down.

However, top tip: If you need to quickly break a 10,20 euro note, any Tesco or Billa or lidl supermarket takes euros, usually at exactly the bank rate. Buy a can of coke, mars bar, etc and pay with your 10 or 20 euros- you will get back the rest in change, CZK, at the current exchange rate, and the time saved in not running round looking for an exchange is now worth the mars bar you are eating.
Have you tried to rideshare with a website such as blablacar? usually people will let you car pool with them into Germany for about 20 euros each way. 
I'm running the Boston marathon on Patriot's day (2015).

I plan to attend the free dinner buffet for marathon runners on the evening of April 19th. However, they've stated that no backpacks/bags are allowed into the dining area. Since I'm checking into my hotel (in Newton) after the dinner, I will need to store it for an hour or two. I am only carrying a small bag.
Less than a mile away is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston-tourism-made-easy.com/boston-storage-lockers.html&quot;&gt;Package Express&lt;/a&gt;. Open till 10pm and $5 (according to the link) you should have time to collect again before they close at 10pm, since your function is scheduled to end at 8pm. However in view of the exceptional circumstances I suggest you give them a call first.  

If not, and not arriving by train so unable to use Amtrak’s Baggage Room, maybe drop your bag off at your hotel before checking-in. That may waste about an hour but alternatives may add delay anyway.

Another possibility is to ask the dinner’s organisers – not allowed into the dining area does not preclude some cloak-room facilities before that area.
Will there be a problem for me arriving in the US if I arrive from Pakistan rather then Thailand where I received my B1/B2 visa?
&lt;strong&gt;€19&lt;/strong&gt; is the lowest fare that's generally available for buses. Fares vary depending on the how full each bus is, so booking either four weeks or more in advance or online very close to departure (some companies have a last minute special) is the best way to secure the cheapest price.

You can compare prices on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.busbud.com/en/bus-schedules/Nuremberg,Bavaria,Germany/Prague,HlavniMestoPraha,CzechRepublic?currency=EUR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Busbud&lt;/a&gt; (full disclosure: I work on this project).

There are 12+ buses a day, most are run by &lt;em&gt;Student Agency&lt;/em&gt; in cooperation with &lt;em&gt;DB IC Bus&lt;/em&gt;, or by &lt;em&gt;Eurolines&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MeinFernbus FlixBus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;SemiTimeS&lt;/em&gt;.

The trip takes about 4 hours.
While it doesn’t specify if it must be &lt;strong&gt;fully&lt;/strong&gt; charged

&lt;strong&gt;TSA&lt;/strong&gt; said:


  As the traveling public knows, all electronic devices are screened by
  security officers. During the security examination, officers may also
  ask that owners power up some devices, including cell phones.
  Powerless devices will not be permitted onboard the aircraft. The
  traveler may also undergo additional screening.


It must at least turn on, so if you buy a new electronic device if it can turn on there should not be a problem, of course as always it depends on the security guard.

But as Gregory says if you bought after the security check there shouldn’t be a problem
Your U.S. visa will not let you visit Canada or any European countries. The only countries I know besides the U.S. that it will allow you to visit are Mexico and Costa Rica. (Possibly some Caribbean countries too, not sure.)
I'm currently in Vancouver and I want to go for a hike. The obvious choice would be Grouse Mountain but unfortunately the Grouse Grind will be closed until May.

So I'm looking for an alternative for a hike that fulfils the following conditions:


The whole activity (going there + hike + going back) should not take more than a day
It should be easily reachable by public transport from downtown Vancouver
It should be feasible to do it on a weekend in April
The hike should not have a higher technical level than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hikr.org/post2984.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;T3&lt;/a&gt;
I would prefer if the hike would lead to a summit or another interesting landmark (nice lake, a cave, etc.)
I would prefer if the hike offers some nice views

Well, as you can tell if you're in Vancouver, the North Shore didn't really get winter this year. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/bcmc-trail/&quot;&gt;BCMC Trail&lt;/a&gt; is just east of the Grouse Grind and starts from the same parking lot - it's also a way better &lt;em&gt;hiking&lt;/em&gt; trail. The Grind is basically a staircase in the forest and it's name is well-earned.

If you don't feel like hiking the trail both ways you can always take the gondola down. 

Alternatively, you could take the gondola to the top of Grouse Mountain and do some hiking at the top as there is very little snow right now. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/goat-mountain/&quot;&gt;Goat Mountain&lt;/a&gt; is a favorite. If you're feeling adventurous you can do both the BCMC and Goat Mountain and ride the gondola down after the return from Goat. 

As for the rating scale you posted you won't find much above the T3 level on the North Shore.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lynn-peak/&quot;&gt;Lynn Peak&lt;/a&gt;(great view) would also be a good hike right now. It was icy in January, but most of it has melted since then. There are other hikes of varying difficulty in &lt;a href=&quot;http://vancouversnorthshore.com/what-to-do-outdoors/parks-and-recreation-areas/lynn-headwaters-regional-park/&quot;&gt;Lynn Headwaters Regional Park&lt;/a&gt; that might interest you as well.
United Airlines has a Premier Qualifying Dollar requirement which is summarized on there page here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/mileageplus/premier/qualify/PQD-FAQs.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/mileageplus/premier/qualify/PQD-FAQs.aspx&lt;/a&gt;

The question of interest states:


  Does the PQD requirement apply to all MileagePlus members?
  
  In 2014 and 2015, the PQD requirement only applies to members whose
  primary address on their MileagePlus account is in the 50 United
  States or the District of Columbia. Members who use U.S. military or
  diplomatic addresses (APO, DPO or FPO) are exempt from the PQD
  requirement.


Now, suppose I am student from Mexico studying in the US; my primary address &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be my (parent's) Mexico address. If they send me something, I would surely know about it and receive it through my parents. That way, I could get around the PQD requirement. Is this a valid get-around? 
&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, that will work fine in practice.  This kind of thing is quite common, eg. many Qantas frequent flyers register addresses overseas to avoid paying membership fees.  (To be clear, you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need to be able to receive mail at this address, via a relative/friend/etc.)

Whether this violates the program's terms and conditions is up to the airline and their lawyers, but I've &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; heard of anybody getting &quot;busted&quot; over this.  In your case, in particular, as a student you can quite easily argue that your permanent residence is in Mexico and you're only temporarily in the US.
There are a huge number of upscale hotels in the area with valet/luggage/concierge service. While I have never tried in Boston, I have never had problems asking a hotel that I am not staying in to hold a bag for a few hours. In the few cases they have asked for a room number, I tell them I am not staying in the hotel as I give them a $5-10 tip.
We are wanting to take a family vacation in the U.K. and want to hire a 12-14 passenger vehicle. I understand a special license is required. We have U.S. License, but don't know if it is possible to get the license required in the U.K. Any help out there?
I am a Canadian citizen w/ a Canadian passport.

I went on a student visitor visa from September 11 2014 to December 17 2014. I'm returning on May 2 and leaving July 30 of this year as a tourist. How long am I able to visit the UK within a 365 day period? Does the fact that there is a period of time between my visits change anything?

I know I'm only allowed to stay as a general visitor/tourist for 6 months at a time. But as these two separate trips total just over 6 months, I am concerned that I will not be allowed to stay this long.

Plus, Deep Cove is a awesome little town to stop for some ice cream, a drink, or a swim after the hike.  It's roughly a half-hour hike up.

From Downtown Vancouver, take the 211 to Phibbs Exchange then transfer to the 212 Deep Cove.  Then, it's a short walk to the trailhead.
I'm a US citizen who is speaking at several EU conferences in Vienna, Prague, and Krakow next month. I'll be using a lot of data while I travel. I am currently a US T-Mobile business customer.

To avoid the exorbitant roaming charges, I would like to pay a single fee and get either unlimited data or a very high cap (30 GiB+) for a period that lasts at least 15 days. I'll pay almost any reasonable amount (say, up to $200), as long as:
